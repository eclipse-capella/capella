/**
 * Test the functional transition - CreateRule-SF01
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Model is created with the following elementsï¿½
 *  
 * - Rename LogicalComponent from Logical Architecture to Logical System
 * - Create Connection into Logical System named LSC1 from CP111(LC11) to CP311(LC31)
 * - Create Connection into Logical System named LSC2 from CP12(LC1) to CP32(LC3)
 * - Create Connection into Logical System named LSC3 from CP112(LC11) to CP21(LC2)
 * - Create StateMachine into Logical System named SM1
 * - Create Region into SM1 named R11
 * - Create Part into Logical System named part_P1 typed by LC1
 * - Create Part into Logical System named part_P2 typed by LC2
 * - Create Part into Logical System named part_P3 typed by LC3
 * - Create Part into Logical System named part_P4 typed by LC4
 * - Create LogicalComponent into Logical System named LC1
 * - Create Part into LC1 named part_P11 typed by LC11
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC1 named CP12
 * - Create LogicalComponent into LC1 named LC11
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC11 named CP111
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC11 named CP112
 * - Create LogicalComponent into Logical System named LC2
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC2 named CP21
 * - Create LogicalComponent into Logical System named LC3
 * - Create Part into LC3 named part_P31 typed by LC31
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC3 named CP32
 * - Create LogicalComponent into LC3 named LC31
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC31 named CP311
 * - Create LogicalComponent into Logical System named LC4
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC4 named CP41
 * - Create Part into LC4 named part_P42 typed by LC41
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC4 named CP43
 * - Create LogicalComponent into LC4 named LC41
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC41 named CP411
 * - Create ComponentPort into LC41 named CP412
 * - Create SystemRealization into Logical System to System
 * - Rename LogicalActorPkg from Logical Architecture to Actors
 * - Create LogicalActor into Actors named LA1
 * - Create ComponentPort into LA1 named ACP11
 * - Create LogicalActor into Actors named LA2
 * - Create ComponentPort into LA2 named ACP21
 * - Create LogicalActor into Actors named LA3
 * - Create ComponentPort into LA3 named ACP31
 * - Create ComponentPort into LA3 named ACP32
 * - Rename LogicalContext from Logical Architecture to Logical Context
 * - Create Connection into Logical Context named C1 from ACP11(LA1) to CP41(LC4)
 * - Create Connection into Logical Context named C2 from ACP21(LA2) to CP411(LC41)
 * - Create Connection into Logical Context named C3 from CP43(LC4) to ACP31(LA3)
 * - Create Connection into Logical Context named C4 from CP412(LC41) to ACP32(LA3)
 * - Create Part into Logical Context named part_LS typed by Logical System
 * - Create Part into Logical Context named part_LA1 typed by LA1
 * - Create Part into Logical Context named part_LA2 typed by LA2
 * - Create Part into Logical Context named part_LA3 typed by LA3
 * 
 * Perform transition of A3
 * 
 * Expected Result:\
 * Perform transition of LS
 * - All sub component should be transitioned, 
 * - All LSC* shouldbe transitioned
 * - Only C3-C4 should be trnasitoned
 * 
 * </pre>
