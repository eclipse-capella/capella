Test the "Refresh All Sub Representations" in a simple scenario:

- Import the model which contains only one diagram.
- Deactive the 2 preferences of Sirius
- Delete some model elements from the Project Explorer
- Save the diagram
- Verify that the diagram has an element with red cross.
- Close the session
- Reopen the session
- Perform the Refresh All Sub Representation
- Verify that the representation of deleted element is also removed from the diagram.
