		<ul>
			<li>Try to open a model (library or project) while one of its referenced libraries is not present in the workspace is not possible.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Nominal_Case_vs_Downgraded_Case">Nominal Case vs Downgraded Case</h2>
		<p>Downgraded use cases are not properly supported. Please be aware of the constraints described in the following section.</p>
		<p>Violation of one of these rules might shift the user into downgraded use cases:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Replace a library by another version while a referencing project is opened (for instance through an update from Clearcase)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Perform a fragmentation or an unfragmentation of a library while a referencing project is opened.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Perform action that creates a reference between two objects from	different models M1, M2 (project or library) where M2 is referencing M1. For instance, if a project is referencing a library, create a generalization from a class in the library to a class in the project. Such a situation can be obtained when moving graphically elements between diagrams.</li>
