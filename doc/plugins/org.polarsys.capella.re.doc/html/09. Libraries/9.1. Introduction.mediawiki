== Concepts ==

A Library is a Capella model intended to be shared between several Projects.


[[Image:Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_65396e1a.png|533x246px]]


A Project can reference a Library with READ or READ/WRITE mode. In the latter case, this means the Library content can be modified from the Project itself, without having to specifically open the Library.


A library can have references towards other Libraries, but a Library cannot have a reference towards a Project.


What are Libraries intended for?


* Allow reuse of model elements across different models (for example, 	several Projects in one domain often need to share the same data 	model).
* Enhance organization (avoid duplication and references between 	models)
* Host catalogs of Replicable Elements

Libraries benefit of same tooling than models.


* Edition of library&rsquo;s content via diagrams and editors
* Semantic browser
* Validation rules &amp; quick fixes[[Image:Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_m2f4cc7f5.jpg|92x92px]][[Image:Images/9.1.%20Introduction_html_733c5d5d.jpg|92x92px]]
