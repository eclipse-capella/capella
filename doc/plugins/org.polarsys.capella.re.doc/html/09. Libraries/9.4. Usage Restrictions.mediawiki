= Usage Restrictions =

== Libraries Usage Restriction ==

* Try to open a model (library or project) while one of its referenced libraries is not present in the workspace is not possible.

== Nominal Case vs Downgraded Case ==

Downgraded use cases are not properly supported. Please be aware of the constraints described in the following section.

Violation of one of these rules might shift the user into downgraded use cases:

* Replace a library by another version while a referencing project is opened (for instance through an update from Clearcase)

* Perform a fragmentation or an unfragmentation of a library while a referencing project is opened.

* Perform action that creates a reference between two objects from	different models M1, M2 (project or library) where M2 is referencing M1. For instance, if a project is referencing a library, create a generalization from a class in the library to a class in the project. Such a situation can be obtained when moving graphically elements between diagrams.
