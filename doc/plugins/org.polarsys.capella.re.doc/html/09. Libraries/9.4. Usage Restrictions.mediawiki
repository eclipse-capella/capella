== Libraries Usage Restriction ==

* Try to open a model (library or project) while 	one of its referenced libraries is not present in the workspace is 	not possible.<br>If you want to use a project without referenced 	libraries you can use the Detach tool to remove references of missing libraries <br>

* Downgraded use cases are not properly supported. Please be aware of 	the constraints described in the following section.

<br>
<br>


== Nominal Case vs Downgraded Case ==

Violation of one of these rules might shift the user into downgraded use cases:


* Replace a library by another version while a referencing project is 	opened (for instance through an update from Clearcase)

* Perform a fragmentation or an unfragmentation of a library while a 	referencing project is opened.

* Perform action that creates a reference between two objects from 	different models M1, M2 (project or library) where M2 is referencing 	M1. For instance, if a project is referencing a library, create a 	generalization from a class in the library to a class in the 	project. Such a situation can be obtained when moving graphically elements between diagrams. Future version of Capella will provide an automatic check to prevent such a situation. <br>
