== Creation of a Library ==

Libraries are created the same way as standard Capella Projects. From the Project Explorer, create a new Library using the Contextual Menu


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m723a4595.png]]


The result is a new model, with the Methodological Overview opened.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_3ee7966e.png]]


In this library, create diagrams and model elements. Here for example, a data model.

Close the Library.


== Referencing a Library ==

Select the &ldquo;Libraries | Manage References&rdquo; item in the contextual menu on the &ldquo;aird&rdquo; file of a standard Project Model.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m74f004a7.png]]


A dialog opens.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m1004a0b5.png]]


The first tab of this dialog displays all the accessible Libraries in the current workspace (A Library in a closed Eclipse Project will not be proposed).


Note that the actual Library files do not have to be physically located in the workspace itself, see the section explaining the Eclipse difference between Workspace and actual Project files.


Ticking the checkbox will create a physical reference between the current Project Model and the Library.

The second tab of the dialog displays which Library is currently active. When a Library is not active, queries in Editors for example will not display the content located in the Library.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m3ec8a6b5.png]]


The third tab allows specifying whether the content of a referenced Library can be directly modified from the Project itself. The default is &ldquo;Read only&rdquo;.


Once the Project Model is opened, the referenced Library can be seen directly from the Project itself.

''' Notices : ''' 
# This wizard seems to provide the functionality to ''Unreference a Library from a Project''. Unckeck the Library in this wizard is only the first-step to perform while unreferencing a library. This operation has a dedicated How-to procedure in the ''Advanced Operations > Unreference a Library'' section.
# As libraries may rely on additional viewpoints, adding reference to a library will make the project depend on those viewpoints. Make sure these viewpoints are also available and installed for all users of the current project.

== Using Library Elements from a Project ==

Elements from the referenced library are accessible from elements in the Project model.


<u>'''Example with the allocation of Exchange Items to a Functional Exchange'''</u>


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m67c8a76c.png]]


The transfer dialog display both elements coming from the current Project and elements from the Library.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_71e0fc21.png]]


Once the allocation is performed, the result can be seen in the Semantic Browser.

<u>'''Example with Components and Interfaces'''</u>


From an interface diagram, use the Insertion tool to select and display an Interface located in the Library.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m130884f.png]]


The selection wizard proposes the Interface located in the Library.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m3dffabd5.png]]


The Interface appears on the diagram.


[[Image:Images/9.2.%20Basic%20Use%20Case_html_m54bda30d.png]]


The Component in the Project Model can now &ldquo;provide&rdquo; the Interface located in the Library.
