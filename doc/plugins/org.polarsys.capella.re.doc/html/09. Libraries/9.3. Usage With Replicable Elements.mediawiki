Create a library


[[Image:Images/9.3_Usage_with_Replicable_Elements.png|500x196px]]


In the Logical Architecture, create some elements and create a REC from them.

Alternatively, select &ldquo;REC/RPL->Create REC->With whole library contents...&rdquo; from the project explorer context menu to automatically add all library elements to the REC.

The dialog displays the content of the REC.

After creation, the REC is available In the library.
