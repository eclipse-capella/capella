It is also possible to do the same via properties view by selecting "Catalog Element Link" contained by REC in Project Explorer.

== Update of a RPL from its REC ==

Select a RPL element and in the contextual menu:

The Semantic Browser can be useful to check if the selection is about the right RPL associated with the right REC.<br/>
The contextual menu is also available directly on the RPL in the Semantic Browser.
|}

The REC instantiation wizard opens and in the left tree, the new elements appear.

Perform modifications if needed (e.g. choosing specific locations for the new elements, modifying the suffix) and click on OK. This will open the merge dialog. Select 'Apply' to update the RPL with additional changes or merge selected changes individually. Confirm the following merge impact dialog to perform the update.


If the suffix is modified, all elements that are intended to be renamed will be updated to have the name of the corresponding REC element with the new suffix. Similarly, if a REC element was renamed, the corresponding RPL elements will be updated with the new REC name and the current RPL suffix. Also, if an existing element has no suffix but its corresponding REC element was marked as having to be renamed, it will be updated with the RPL suffix.

Update the diagram to see the result.

== Update of a REC from its RPL ==

Perform a few modifications on elements belonging to a RPL.


[[Image:Images/8.3.%20Update%20REC-RPL_html_2b539e6f.png|360x290px]]


From the contextual menu, select:


[[Image:Images/8.3.%20Update%20REC-RPL_html_m41eba791.png|627x114px]]

{| border="1"
|-
| 
[[Image:Images/InfoIcon.png|48x48px]]
| 
The Semantic Browser can be useful to check if the selection is about the right RPL associated with the right REC.<br/>
The contextual menu is also available directly on the RPL in the Semantic Browser.
|}

This opens the REC definition dialog. The changes are visible in the tree.


[[Image:Images/8.3.%20Update%20REC-RPL_html_4875b314.png|622x607px]]


From here, the behavior is the same as when the definition update was created directly from the REC elements.
