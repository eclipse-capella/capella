Replicable Elements are mechanisms allowing the easy reuse of model parts.


* A 	'''Replicable 	Elements Collection (REC)''' 	is a definition of an element / set of elements which can be used in 	multiple contexts / configurations / models.
* A '''Replica 	(RPL)''' 	is a use (instantiation) of a Replicable Elements Collection in a 	given context / configuration / model.

A REC can be viewed as a &ldquo;contract&rdquo; to which all its RPLs must comply. REC can embed RPLs of other RECs.

'''REC and RPL are located in Catalogs'''. Technically, REC and RPL are technical objects pointing towards the list of the elements they embed.


Capella provides tooling to manage the creation of REC and their instantiation, as well as update mechanisms (from REC to RPL and from RPL to REC) and validation rules.

Different kinds of conformance are possible between a RPL and its REC. Capella defines three default kinds of conformance, but end-user can define their own ones.


* Blackbox: No modification is allowed on the Replica.
* Constrained Reuse: Internal elements can be added inside a RPL, but 	constraints and Interfaces (Function and Component Ports for 	example) defined in REC cannot be modified.
* Inheritance: Any element can be added in the RPL, including new 	Interfaces.
