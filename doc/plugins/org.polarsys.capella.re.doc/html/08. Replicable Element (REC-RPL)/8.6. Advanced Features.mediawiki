== Management of Composition of REC-RPL ==

We are going to see how to use libraries and REC-RPL composition in order to create a set of elements based on library elements and data types through an example.


# Create a library to define the 	data types and elements types<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_2284e832.png|676x159px]]<br>For this example, we call it '''lib_cps''' to express it's a library dedicated to define some components.<br><br>
# Add some 	data types and create a physical node component '''Board''' 	containing the following physical attributes<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_62ca2f9f.png|187x97px]] [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m233d6be5.png|174x93px]]<br><br>
# In the 	tree, select the component '''Board''', 	choose ''''REC 	/ RPL &gt; Create a REC from selection''''<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_fecc182.png|660x176px]]<br><br>In the REC creation window, the component and its children are automatically added to the REC.<br><br>Notice the message &quot;REC have references to external elements&quot;, an additional window shows the elements that will not be instantiated in the destination model. Any RPL of the to be created REC Board will be linked to these elements<br><br>Remark: it is possible to add these external elements in the REC by pressing the button [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_c388e3a.png|24x20px]] and selecting them. In that case, these elements will be considered as &ldquo;part of&rdquo; the created REC and any RPL will have its own data types.<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_7759190e.png|822x603px]]<br><br>Now we are going to create a Rack compound by two replicas of Board.<br><br>
# Create a 	physical node component '''Rack'''<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m52755ad8.png|160x85px]]<br><br>
# In the 	tree, right click on '''Rack''' 	and choose ''''REC/RPL 	&gt; Instantiate a RPL from a REC' '''<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_25459aa1.png|656x176px]]<br><br>Then select '''REC_Board''' and add the suffix _1 and validate twice with no modifications.<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m5a8a33fd.png|546x632px]]<br><br>Repeat the operation another time to create a second '''Board''' on the '''Rack'''<br><br>Remark: is it possible to place the newly created RPL into the directory '''REC Catalog / RPL''' to ease the reading of the model.<br><br>[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m5a294393.png|250x139px]]<br><br>Notice the message &quot;REC have references to external elements&quot;, the button trigger an additional window allowing to select from the elements linked to the REC elements which elements will be linked to elements of the RPL.<br><br> 
# In the 	tree, right click on '''Rack''' 	and choose ''''REC/RPL 	&gt; Create a REC from selection&rsquo; '''

# Two choices are possible to 	create the REC Rack:
## Simple 		REC linked to all elements viewed in the wizard, which will happen 		by clicking directly on OK (same process than REC Board creation, 		not detailed below)
### Pro: Simple way to create a 			REC
### Con: If 			Board is more complicated than a self-contained component, 			(allocated functions, interfaces), some elements will not be 			included if they weren&rsquo;t selected when creating the 			REC_Rack, even if they are part of an existing RPL.
### Con: If Board evolves by 			adding other elements, these elements will not be added 			automatically to the REC_Rack and its RPL. You will have to update 			manually REC_Rack to include these new elements.
## Compound 		REC, where REC Rack is only a Component Rack with two Replica of 		Board (whatever elements are included in Board) (detailed below)
### Pro: all elements of a 			Replica of Board will be included automatically, even if REC_Board 			is updated


<br>
<br>


For both '''Board''', select the related RPL like below. In the main dialog, RPL are added and components Board are now colored in purple, meaning that a related RPL have been added to the REC. These elements will be also added at RPL instanciation

<br>
<br>


At end of the wizard, created '''REC_Rack''' is linked to the Rack and both RPL of '''Board'''

<br>


# In a 	model with dependencies to the '''lib_cps''':

[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m6ec962dc.png|262x306px]]


Create a RPL of the '''REC_Rack''' in Physical System


[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m1eb7c6e0.png|694x206px]]


<br>
<br>


[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_4b18a5c9.png|530x612px]]


In the model, a component Rack has been created and two RPL of boards.


[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_3dbc82aa.png|220x247px]]


<br>
<br>


''Note: There is no component Board created. Both replica should have been created and initialized after the instantiation of the RPL_Rack. This is a current limitation of the tooling, but it should not be the case''.<br>
For both RPL of Board, an &ldquo;Update selected RPL from its REC&rdquo; must be triggered. Once these Board have been initialized, another &ldquo;Update selected RPL from its REC&rdquo; on the RPL_Rack can be necessary if there is elements linking the two Board. (which is not the case here)


[[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_3cc99ac0.png|245x70px]] [[Image:Images/8.6.%20Advanced%20Features_html_m1e59d7b.png|628x123px]]


We have now a full RPL of Rack

== Promotion of a REC to a Library ==

From elements of a model, it would be possible to create a REC into a referenced library. <br>
Elements will be copied into the library and become a REC and initial selected elements will be considered as a RPL of the REC stored in the library.

== Selecting all related Elements of a given REC on a diagram ==

It is possible to select all elements of a given REC that are displayed on a diagram.

To do so, select a source element from the REC, right click "Capella Select > Related Rec Elements > REC"
This will set the current selection to all this REC source elements, that are displayed on the diagram

== Selecting all related Elements of a given RPL on a diagram ==

It is possible to select all elements of a given RPL that are displayed on a diagram.

To do so, select an element from the RPL, right click "Capella Select > Related Rpl Elements > RPL"
This will set the current selection to all this RPL elements, that are displayed on the diagram

This is particularly useful to copy/paste a layout from a REC to its RPLs
