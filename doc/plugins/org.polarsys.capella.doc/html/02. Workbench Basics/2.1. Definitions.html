	<h2 id="RESOURCES">RESOURCES</h2>
	<p>From the user perspective there are three different types of
		resources:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Files: comparable to files in the file system. In its most
			basic form, a Capella model consists in two files, one for the real
			model elements (the semantic model) and one for the representations
			(views on the model, through diagrams or tables).</li>
		<li>Folders: comparable to directories in the file system. In the
			workbench, folders are contained in projects or other folders.
			Folders can contain files and other folders.</li>
		<li>Projects: contain folders and files.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2 id="PROJECTS">PROJECTS</h2>
	<p>Projects are created in a workspace and can have a nature
		(Capella projects, Java projects &hellip;). They are used for builds,
		version management, sharing and resource organization. Like folders,
		Projects map to directories in the file system. A location in the file
		system is specified during the project creation.</p>
	<p>A project is either open or closed. A closed project cannot be
		changed in the workbench: its resources will not appear in the
		workbench, but they still reside on the local file system. Closing
		unused projects can improve the platform performances: closed projects
		require less memory and are not examined during builds. The structure
		of an open project can be changed and displayed.</p>
	<h2 id="WORKSPACES">WORKSPACES</h2>
	<p>The workspace is the Eclipse central hub for user&rsquo;s files.
		The platform and several plug-ins use workspace to store global
		settings and preferences in a hidden sub-folder
		&ldquo;.metadata&rdquo;. Start Eclipse with the &ldquo;-clean&rdquo;
		option erases these parameters.</p>
	<p>When the workbench is launched, a dialog allows the user to
		select a workspace. The workbench manages only a single workspace at
		once but it is possible to switch between several workspaces.</p>
	<p>Arrange projects in several workspaces can be useful: a too
		large number of opened projects can considerably slow down Eclipse.
		Projects can be physically located in the Workspace or be referenced.</p>
	<h2 id="PERSPECTIVES">PERSPECTIVES</h2>
	<p>Perspective defines the initial set of actions and parts that
		appears in the workbench window. A perspective is a group of views and
		editors in the workbench window. One or more perspectives can exist in
		a single workbench window. Within a window, each perspective may have
		a different set of views but all perspectives share the same set of
		editors.</p>
	<p>Each perspective provides a set of functionality aimed at
		accomplishing a specific task or works with specific types of
		resources. For example, the Java perspective combines view commonly
		used for editing Java source files, while the Capella perspective
		contains views for Model Driven Engineering.</p>
	<p>Capella consists in one single Perspective, which is loaded by
		default when Capella is started.</p>
	<h2 id="VIEWS">VIEWS</h2>
	<p>A view is a visual component within the workbench. It is
		typically used to navigate a list or hierarchy of information (such as
		the resources in the workbench), or display properties for the active
		editor. It can support editors and provides information and
		alternative presentation. Modifications made in a view are saved
		immediately if the view is not attached to an editor.</p>
	<p>For example, the Capella Project Explorer and other navigation
		views display projects and other resources the user is working with,
		while the Information view displays information that provides feedback
		to several Capella &ldquo;complex&rdquo; processes.</p>
	<h2 id="EDITORS">EDITORS</h2>
	<p>An editor is also a visual component within the workbench. It is
		typically used to edit or browse a resource. Editors are launched by
		(double-)clicking on a resource in a view. Modifications mad in an
		editor follow an open-save-close lifecycle model.</p>
	<p>Editors are associated with types of files. Double-clicking a
		file in a navigation view will opens the associated editor in the
		workbench.</p>
	<p>Depending on the type of file being edited, the appropriate
		editor is displayed in the editor area. For example, a text editor is
		displayed in order to edit a .TXT file. The name of the file appears
		in the editor tab. An asterisk (*) at the left side of this tab
		indicates that the editor has unsaved changes.</p>

		<tr>
			<td><img height="48" width="48" border="0"
				src="Images/2.1.%20Definitions_html_3c78e109.png" /></td>
			<td>Some features are common to both views and editors. The term
				&ldquo;<b>part</b>&rdquo; is used to mean either a view or an
				editor. Parts can be active or inactive, but only one part can be
				active at any one time, its title bar is then highlighted. The
				active part is the target for common operations like cut, copy,
				paste. It also determines the contents of the status line.
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><br /></td>
			<td>If an editor part is not highlighted it indicates the editor
				is not active; however views may show information based on the last
				active editor.</td>
