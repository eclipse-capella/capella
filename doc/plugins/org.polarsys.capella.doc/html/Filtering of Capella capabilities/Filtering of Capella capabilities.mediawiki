Capabilities allow us to enable or disable certain components of Capella product. Some categories of Capella functionalities have been predefined in the Capabilities preference page are:
* '''Capella Advanced Modeling''' includes functionalities for advanced users, for instance the Expert property view (this view is disabled by default, to be used with extreme caution).
* '''Capella Concepts''' includes functionalities concerning Capella System Engineering concepts, for instance the behavior component concept
* '''Capella Phases''' includes functionalities available in different Capella phases, for instance the Operational Analysis phase.
* '''Capella Tools''' includes various Capella tools, for instance the Transitions tool
