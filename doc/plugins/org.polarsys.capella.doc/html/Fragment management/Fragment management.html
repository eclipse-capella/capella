A fragment can also be split in multiple sub-fragments.</p><p><img height="411" width="396" border="0" src="Images/FragmentManagement_m1d9aa67f.png"/></p><h2 id="Why_splitting_Models_into_Fragments.3F">Why splitting Models into Fragments?</h2><p>A model may be split using functional concerns. In Capella, it is highly recommended to split the model by architecture. Architecture is a description of the underlying system under different points of view.</p><p>As a reminder, in Capella, there are 5 types of architecture (Operational Analysis, System, Logical, Physical, EPBS = Organizational). The recommended strategy is to create fragments for those elements.</p><p>A model may be split using organisational concerns. A user or group is responsible for a part of the model. Then a fragment is dedicated to the user or group. As a consequence the user or group can reserve checkout this part to make changes and check-in when the job is done.</p><p>NOTE: This strategy does not ensure the best collaboration between team members but it encourages formal exchanges.</p><p>NOTE: Tooling cannot support every situation; fragments are provided for technical reason (to limit file size and to avoid huge files) and to separate responsibilities into sub-model files.</p><p>The model can be split in fragments on most of the package types, on Classes, on Functions, etc.</p><h2 id="Available_Elements">Available Elements</h2><p>The available elements are:</p><ul><li>Architectures,</li><li>Packages like InterfacePkg, DataPkg&hellip;</li><li>Functions, Classes, etc.</li><li>Components and Actors</li></ul><p><br/>
