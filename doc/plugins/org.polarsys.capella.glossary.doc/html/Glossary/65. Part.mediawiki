=== DEFINITION ===

Parts for Components are similar to Properties for Classes. They allow reusing Component definitions (Type) in several contexts.


Parts help defining assembly of Components. Parts might have cardinalities.


Note: Parts should not be used when following the Arcadia methodology, as Components in that case are considered as unique Instances. Reuse in Arcadia is managed with Model Patterns.
