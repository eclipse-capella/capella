= FUNCTION PORT =

=== DEFINITION ===

A Function receives inputs and delivers outputs via Function Ports. Each Input Port describes an expected input (Exchange Items), each Output Port describes an available output.


A Function Port is usually identified by its name (e.g. &lsquo;tuning parameters&rsquo;, &lsquo;equalized signal&rsquo;).


Function Ports can be given non functional properties characterizing the input needs or output capabilities of the Function it belongs to: e.g. specifying that a sampling function can deliver x samples per second, and compare it to a playback function needing y samples per second at input. Such non-functional properties allow securing the external use of the Function w.r.t. input and output flows: no consistency check would be possible when reusing it elsewhere in the system or from one system to another.
