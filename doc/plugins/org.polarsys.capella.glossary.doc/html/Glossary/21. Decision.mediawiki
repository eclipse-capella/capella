=== DEFINITION ===

The Decision control Function expresses a conditional course from input flow towards one of the output flows, according to a condition expression, usually based on flow contents.


* A Decision Function in a dataflow selects one output exchange among 	many, depending on its entries and the condition
* One condition is defined for each output; it is a logical 	combination of Boolean expressions (resulting in true or false 	value)

Condition might involve:


* Input exchanges or port contents (data in exchange items)
* Attributes of source function (e.g. non functional properties)
* Some global data in the model, such as active states or modes.

Only one output exchange is activated, depending on the condition that is satisfied.


Care should be taken to ensure that at least one output could be activated under any condition.
