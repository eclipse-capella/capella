=== DEFINITION ===

Property Values are kinds of free annotations on Capella elements. They are usually used to store specific (possibly domain-related) information not managed natively by Capella.


Among others, Property Values are often used for Viewpoints (in order to annotate models with Safety, Performance, IVVQ data).
