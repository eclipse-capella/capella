=== DEFINITION ===

The main objective of the Logical Architecture is to identify the System/Software parts (hereafter called Components), their contents, relationships and properties, excluding implementation or technical/technological issues or specificities.


In order for this breakdown in components to be stable in further steps, all major &#91;non-functional&#93; constraints (safety, security, performance, IVV&hellip;) are taken into account so as to find the best compromise between them.


Outputs of the Logical Architecture are: Components &amp; Interfaces definition, including formalization of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the components design.
