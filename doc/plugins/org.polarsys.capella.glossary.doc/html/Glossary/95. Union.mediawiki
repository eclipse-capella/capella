=== DEFINITION ===

Unions are structures that can take different formats according to the values of a Discriminator.


Like Classes, Unions have Properties (called Union Properties). Union Properties might (or have to) be associated to possible Values of the Union Discriminator.


Instances of a given Union type do not have Values for all Properties defined in the Union but only for the ones that are &ldquo;active&rdquo; for a given Discriminator Value.
