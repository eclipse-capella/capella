=== DEFINITION ===

A Functional Chain is a mean to describe one specific path among all possible paths traversing the dataflow,


* either to describe an expected behavior of the System in a given 	context,
* or in order to express some non functional properties along this 	functional path (latency, criticality, confidentiality, 	redundancy...).

An elementary Functional Chain is made of a succession of Functions and Exchanges across a functional dataflow, starting and ending with a Function (allocated to the System or to an Actor).
