		<h3 id="DEFINITION">DEFINITION</h3>
		<p>The main objective of the Logical Architecture is to identify the System/Software parts (hereafter called Components), their contents, relationships and properties, excluding implementation or technical/technological issues or specificities.</p>
		<p>In order for this breakdown in components to be stable in further steps, all major &#91;non-functional&#93; constraints (safety, security, performance, IVV&hellip;) are taken into account so as to find the best compromise between them.</p>
		<p>Outputs of the Logical Architecture are: Components &amp; Interfaces definition, including formalization of all viewpoints and the way they are taken into account in the components design.</p>
