=== DEFINITION ===

Scenarios describe dynamic, time-related interactions between elements: Operational Entities and Actors, the System itself, the System Components. These interactions are expressed through temporally ordered Sequence Messages.


Scenarios illustrate Capabilities. For example, they are useful to describe


* How Operational Entities and Actors cooperate, and how Operational 	Processes are chained
* How the System is used under operational conditions, how it 	interacts with external Systems and Users
* Use Cases of the system
* Dynamic behavior of the system (either expected or designed): 	dynamicity, order, Modes &amp; States evolutions. etc.
* Non functional constraints or situations: performance expectations 	(latency...), safety failure scenarios, security attacks...
