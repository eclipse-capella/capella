* Creation of a Component Exchange Scenario (CES)
'''Logical Architecture'''
* Transition to Logical Architecture
* Enrichment of the Functional Tree
* Allocation of Functions to Components
* Allocation of Exchange Items to Functional Exchanges
* Transition of CES from System Analysis
* Enrichment of Logical CES
'''Physical Architecture'''
* Transition from Logical Architecture
* Creation of a Physical Architecture diagram
* Generation of Component Exchanges, Physical Links, Interfaces
* Transition of CES from Logical Architecture
* Initialization of a Component Interface Scenario (CIS) from the CES
