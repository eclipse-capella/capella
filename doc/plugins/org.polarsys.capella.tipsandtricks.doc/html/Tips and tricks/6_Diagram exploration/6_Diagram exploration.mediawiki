=Diagram Exploration=
==Find an element in a diagram==

The '''''Ctrl+o''''' command enables to display for a dedicated diagram, in an independent window (as following), every diagram elements.

==Diagram outline==

When the diagram is dense, the '''''Outline View''''' enables to navigate in the diagram per diagram area.

==Scroll in a large diagram==

If a diagram is large, it is possible to scroll easily through the diagram in all directions (both horizontally and vertically at the same time) by using on of the shortcuts below:

* '''Space''' + '''left click '''
* '''Mouse wheel click'''

==Selection menu in diagram==

The new '''Select''' menu in diagram consists of tools for highlighting related elements to the selected element(s) on the diagram. For instance, on a SAB diagram, select a ''function'' and right click on the contextual menu '''Select/Elements of Same Type''' will select all functions on the SAB diagram.

* Select '''one''' or '''many''' elements on the diagram and right-click to have the contextual menu.
* Based on those selected elements, tools will be dynamically added to the menu '''Select'''

[[File:../../Images/Tips83.png|thumbnail|]]

The available tools are:

{| class="wikitable"
|'''Elements of Same Type'''
|Select all elements on the active diagram which have the '''same type''' as the current selected element(s)
|-
|'''Resembling Elements'''
|Select all elements on the active diagram which have the '''same mapping''' as the current selected element(s)
|-
|'''Owned ports'''
|Select all ports on the active diagram which are owned by the current selected element(s)
|-
|'''Owned elements'''
|Select all elements on the active diagram which are owned by the current selected element(s)
|-
|'''Related connections'''
|Select all connections on the active diagram which are related to the current selected element(s)
|}

==Generic connection creation tool==

A new tool called '''Generic Connection Creation Tool''' is added to the palette of diagram allowing create new edge more dynamically:

* Select the tool icon [[Image:../../Images/IconCreateEdgeView.gif]] on the palette.
* Select a graphical element on the diagram as '''source''' of a new edge
* Select a graphical element on the diagram as '''target''' of a new edge
* According to the selected source and target, a list of possible types of edge will be proposed as a contextual menu.

==Organize diagrams in Project Explorer==
When the number of diagrams increases, it is necessary to organize them. 

====Organize diagrams by drag and drop====
Blank diagrams (for instance XAB and IDB) can be drag and dropped between Components or Component packages. For example, a sub-package can be created under the Logical System to group certain LAB diagrams as follows: 

[[File:../../Images/DiagramsInPackage.png|thumbnail|]]

====Organize diagrams via package tag====
Another way to organize diagrams is via package tag. Several diagrams can be grouped together in a package tag. In the view '''Properties''' of a diagram, it is possible to:

* Create a new package
* Add a diagram to an existing package

==Visibility Mode - new Sirius layer to manage hidden graphical elements==

The '''Visibility Mode''' allows to visualize all elements of the diagram: if an element is currently invisible because of an active filter or being hidden by user, it will be shown with transparency.

This mode can be activated from the toolbar of diagram.

[[File:../../Images/Tips86.png|thumbnail|]]

If the '''Visibility Mode''' is active, double-clicking on a graphical element will change its visibility (from visible to invisible and vice versa) without modifying semantic models:

* If a selected diagram element is currently invisible and it is contained by an invisible element, both of them will be made visible.
* If a selected diagram element is currently invisible and it contains hidden children, the element will be made visible and its children will be displayed with transparency.
* If a selected diagram element is an edge, it will change the visibility of its source and target as well.
* If a selected diagram element is currently invisible because of an active filter, a dialog will be prompted to ask for deactivating the filter.
* If a selected diagram element is currently invisible because of an inactive layer, a dialog will be prompted to ask for activating the layer.

This '''Visibility Mode''' is not persisted: when a diagram is closed, the mode is automatically disabled.

==Note as graphical link toward other diagram==
The new tool '''Representation Link''' in the palette allows to create a graphical link toward an existing diagram. 

* The linked diagram is represented as a node element
* The content of note is synchronized with the name of linked diagram
* '''Double-clicking''' on the note will open the linked diagram

==Refresh many representations at once==
On the '''Project Explorer''', it is possible to refresh at once many ''sub''-representations related to a selected element.

==Title Blocks==
The title blocks enables the possibility to add information about diagram elements or the diagram itself and can be shown in diagram to provide additional information chosen by users.
Additional details about title blocks (tools, customization) can be found below:
