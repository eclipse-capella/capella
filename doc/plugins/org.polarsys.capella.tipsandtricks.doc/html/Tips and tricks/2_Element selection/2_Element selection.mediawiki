==Automatic Cursor Selection Of Diagram Elements==

When a diagram displays a lot of elements (components, functions, edges...) it can be fastidious to select some of them to apply a specific styling or other.

That's why, two selection modes are available with the mouse cursor:

# '''''From the left to the right: '''''to select the elements contained in the selection area (Figure 1). (for example if you want to select all ports of a component on the same side without selecting the exchanges or the component itself.)
# '''''From the right to the left: '''''to select the elements contained in the selection area '''''AND''''' also those which cross it (Figure 2). (for example if you want to select exchanges without their ports.)

==Connectors Selection==

Connectors can be selected one by one. As it can be fastidious to select all the connectors of a diagram one by one, to change the routing style or remove bend point for example, use the button '''''Select All Connectors''''' on the diagram menu instead.

==Select only elements of container with ALT==

On a diagram like ''Physical Architecture Blank - PAB'', a component node may contain many child-component nodes inside itself. It is difficult to select the child-components without selecting the parent-component because usually the first click will be on the parent-component's background.

By combining with the '''ALT''' button, the selection will ignore the parent-component or more specifically the element on which the first click happened.

Moving mouse '''Right to Left''' or '''Left to Right''' and pushing the '''ALT''' button will combine the two ways of selecting.
