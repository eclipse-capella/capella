=Other Layout Facilities=

In order to '''facilitate the layout set up of elements on diagrams''', some Diagram facilities exist:  

==Elements Alignment==

If you select at least two elements, you can align them on the right, middle, left, top...

This can also be achieved on edge labels, however for it to work, you need to select the labels (and not the edges)

==Elements Distribution==

If you select at least 3 elements, you can distribute them vertically, horizontally (i.e ensure that there is a gap of the same size between each element in the chosen direction).

This can also be achieved on edge labels, however for it to work, you need to select the labels (and not the edges)

==Layout commands to set edges with connected ports vertical or horizontal  ==


The goal of this feature is to '''assist user to set edge selection vertical or horizontal''' in order to help exchange layout. If the edge is connected to "ports", the '''"port" is moved too'''.''
To do this, it is recommended to layout all connected ports first, then use the right-to-left multiple selection.

==Multi selection for graphical move of ports+exchanges  ==

This feature aims to '''move the group {edge, labels, ports}''' in a single operation when using the '''''F3 shortcut''''' and drag/move the edge.

Moreover, by selecting multiple edges with ports and pressing '''''F3''''' key, you can move them simultaneously:

==Snap back labels on edge selection==
Although there is already a button to snap back a label to it original position on label selection, a new button "''Snap Back Label(s)''" '''on edge selection''' allows to snap back all labels (source, middle, target) of this edge at the same time:

==Display link between an edge and its label==
It is a new preference added in '''Sirius > Sirius Diagram > Connections''':

When you '''select an edge or a label''', graphical link appears between them:

==Copy Paste Of Notes==

To quickly copy paste Notes on a diagram, '''click on CTRL and move the Notes''': new Notes are created.

==Add vertical blank space on sequence diagrams==
On a sequence diagram, instead of moving vertically each graphical element in order to have more space, it is possible to do it more easily by using the combination:

* Hold '''Ctrl'''
* Hold '''Shift'''
* Hold '''Left-Mouse'''
* Move the mouse downwards.
