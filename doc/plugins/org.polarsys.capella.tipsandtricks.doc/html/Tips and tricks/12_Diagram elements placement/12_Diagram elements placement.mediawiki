==Snap to grid==

The ''Snap to grid'' feature '''allows''' '''editing parts to snap to the grid when editing''' (during creation, moving or resizing).

Moreover, by pressing the '''''Alt shortcut key''''', it is possible '''to temporarily place an element independently of the grid.'''

At the end of this action, the functionality will return to active automatically. 

==Snap to shapes==

The ''Snap to shapes'' feature '''allows you to quickly align parts being dragged or resized to other parts in the diagram or that share the same parent''' (N.B: edit parts inside a compartment can only snap to each other). The snap is effective on top, bottom, right, left and center of the figure. Feedback is shown in the form of a gray line when a part is being attached to another part.

To manage it, some preferences have to be configured in '''''Preferences/Sirius/SiriusDiagram/RulerAndGrids'''. ''Select'' '''Snap to shapes for new diagrams'''.''
