=Navigation Menu=
The navigation menu consists of several useful menu items that enables navigating an element between different views. For instance, from a selected graphical element on the diagram editor, users can navigate easily to its associated semantic element on the Project Explorer. 

The navigation menu is available for most of the views. However, based on the type of selected element and the active view, the menu can display with different items.
