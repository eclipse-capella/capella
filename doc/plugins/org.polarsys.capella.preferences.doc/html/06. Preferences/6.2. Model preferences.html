		<p>The &ldquo;Check model version at load time&rdquo; provides a security when opening a model. It checks whether the model has been produced with the current version and thus

			<b>The drawback of activating this check is that the opening of models takes twice as long</b>.

		</p>
		<p>When &ldquo;
			<b>Delete related associations when a class becomes primitive</b>&rdquo; is activated, existing associations towards the class which primitive status has changed is deleted automatically. If this option is not activated, then model validation is such cases will raise an error and the end user will be able to manually delete the obsolete association.

			</li>
			<li>The checkbox &ldquo;
				<b>Transit interfaces handled by Components</b>&rdquo; specifies whether interfaces are realized from one architecture to another when performing a transition.

			<li>The checkbox &ldquo;
				<b>Transit allocated Exchange Items while transition of Interfaces, Functions or Components</b>&rdquo; specifies whether Interfaces, Functions or Components transition triggers transition of related Exchange Items (i.e. duplicates Exchange Items from one engineering phase to the following one).

			</li>
			<li>The checkbox &ldquo;
				<b>Transit Data Types handled by Exchange Items while transition of Exchange Items</b>&rdquo; specifies whether Exchange Items transition triggers transition of related Data (i.e. duplicates Data from one engineering phase to the following one).

			</li>
			<li>The checkbox &ldquo;
				<b>Transit State Machines owned by a Component while transition of Components</b>&rdquo; specifies whether State Machines transition is triggered when performing a Component transition.
			</li>
