By default, &ldquo;'''Automatic Refresh'''&rdquo; is set to true (see the Eclipse Window / Preferences / Viewpoint page): this means diagrams always display the latest state of the model. There are at least two cases where it is recommended to rely on manual rather than automatic refresh:


* When diagrams size grows, it might be necessary to disable automatic 	refresh in order to improve performance. In that case, new 	calculated elements can be displayed on a diagram by performing a 	manual refresh through the specific toolbar Refresh button or by 	reopening the diagram.
* When several users collaborate on the same model using Clearcase or 	SVN.

&ldquo;'''Do refresh on representation opening'''&rdquo; specifies whether a refresh is systematically performed when opening a diagram. Unless working in a collaborative environment with Clearcase or SVN, this option should be set to True.


The option &ldquo;'''Always create a aird fragment on control'''&rdquo; should always be activated. It allows keeping the model and representation files fragmented accordingly.


''The two other options in this page are irrelevant in the context of Capella.''

The &ldquo;'''Viewpoint Diagram'''&rdquo; subsection contains a set of preferences specifically related to diagrams.

Then, you can manage diagrams settings such as diagrams appearances, connection style, general printing settings and rulers & grids options.
