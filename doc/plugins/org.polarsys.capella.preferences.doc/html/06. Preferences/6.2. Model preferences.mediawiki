The &ldquo;Check model version at load time&rdquo; provides a security when opening a model. It checks whether the model has been produced with the current version and thus '''whether it needs to be migrated or not'''. '''The drawback of activating this check is that the opening of models takes twice as long'''.


The AIRD Fragment File Extension option allows specifying the expected file suffix for AIRD fragments.

== Delete ==

On the sub section of '''Capella / Delete preferences''', it is possible to specify deletion options:


* If &ldquo;'''Confirm deletions'''&rdquo; is activated, then a confirmation dialog will be prompted for each deletion attempt. This dialog show a live impact analysis of the deletion.
* If &ldquo;'''If reusing components is allowed, synchronize &hellip;'''&rdquo; is activated, then when deleting a Component, all the Parts that are typed by this component will be deleted as well.

'''Protected Elements''': It is possible to prohibit the deletion of certain critical elements (enabled by default). In that case, it will not be possible to delete these elements.

It is possible to identify protected elements in Project Explorer by enabling a decorator '''Capella Protected Elements''' under the General > Appearance > Label and Decorators section.


[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_497e9b20.png|699x513px]]


The following figure illustrates the prompted dialog when deleting the System Actor &ldquo;Mission Control Operator&rdquo;. All the elements in red will be deleted if the deletion is confirmed. The blue elements are the references towards the elements that are going to be deleted.

== Diagram ==

[[Image:Images/6.2%20Diagram_preferences_diagrams_navigation.png]]

=== Preferences for displaying diagrams ===

On the sub section of '''Capella / Diagram''', it is possible to specify preferences for displaying diagrams:

When &ldquo;'''Navigate to related diagrams on double click'''&rdquo; is activated, double clicking on specific elements will navigate to related diagrams instead of opening the Properties dialog.

This preference is enabled by default.

These specific elements are :
* '''Scenarios''', '''InteractionUse'''
* '''Functional Chain''', '''Functional Chain Reference''', '''Operational Process'''
* '''Physical Path'''

Double clicks in Semantic Browser view, Diagram editor and Project Explorer are affected.

The behaviour differs whether the element has related diagrams or not :

*If the '''element has only one related diagram''', navigation will be made towards this diagram.

*If the '''element has multiple related diagrams''', a dialog will open and let the user choose which diagram to open.
[[Image:Images/6.2%20Diagram_preferences_multiple_diagrams_navigation.png|498x153px]]

*If the '''element has no diagram''', a diagram creation dialog is display
**If there is '''only one diagram type available for that element''', the dialog let the user choose the new diagram name. 
[[Image:Images/6.2%20Diagram_preferences_one_diagram_creation.png|469x220px]]
**If there is '''multiple diagram type available for that element''', the dialog let the user choose which diagram to create and its name.
[[Image:Images/6.2%20Diagram_preferences_multiple_diagrams_creation.png|484x269px]]

=== Date preferences ===

This section allows to define how the date is computed.

The date format field allows to define the date format.

The time zone field allows to define the time zone in two ways:
* (default) '''SYSTEM''' : This value allows to take the system time zone. This is recommended if every users are working in the same time zone. It will not change the displayed date if the time goes from summer time to winter time.
* The time zone can otherwise be defined either with an abbreviation such as "PST", a full name such as "America/Los_Angeles", or a customID such as "GMT+2". 
 

{| border="1"
|-
| 
[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_3c78e109.png|48x48px]]
| 
The date can be computed using these preferences with ''org.polarsys.capella.core.sirius.analysis.CapellaServices.getLastModificationDate(EObject)''. For example you can use it in a "Title block" with the AQL expression ''aql:self.getLastModificationDate()''.
|-
| 
[[Image:Images/Warning_ExclamationPoint.png|48x48px]]
| 
If one of theses preferences is changed the diagram displaying the date in a "Title block" will become dirty after a refresh.
|} 

=== Process/Chain/Path Display ===

On the sub section of '''Capella / Diagram / Process/Chain/Path Display''', it is possible to specify preferences for displaying processes, Chains, paths in diagrams:

* If &ldquo;'''Show 'Incomplete' in the chain/path/process's label'''&rdquo; is activated, then incomplete chain/path/process's labels are annotated with ''Incomplete''.
* If &ldquo;'''Show 'Invalid' in the chain/path/process's label'''&rdquo; is activated, then invalid chain/path/process's labels are annotated with ''Invalid''.

[[Image:Images/Process_Chain_Path_DiagramPreferences.png]]

=== Title Block ===

On the sub section of '''Capella / Diagram / Title Block''', it is possible to specify preferences for displaying a Diagram Title Block in diagrams:

[[Image:Images/Title_Block_Default_DiagramPreferences.png]]

* If &ldquo;'''Add by default Diagram Title Block on empty diagrams'''&rdquo; is activated, then when a new diagram is created, a new Diagram Title Block is also created by default.
* By right clicking on a cell, it is possible to insert or remove new lines and columns.

[[Image:Images/Title_Block_DiagramPreferences.png]]

* The content of each cell can be edited by double clicking on it.

[[Image:Images/Title_Block_CellDefault_DiagramPreferences.png]]

* name: enter the name (label) that will be displayed as the header of the cell
* content: type a query that will provide the content that we need to display in the cell of the Diagram Title Block. The content of data fields can be customized via:
** [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.ui.doc/html/12.%20Model%20Analysis/12.5.1%20AQL%20Queries.html|AQL queries]] (aql:)
** Name of feature (feature:)
** Semantic browser queries (capella:)

* For Capella services: Name of data field (if not specified) are deduced from the contributed service.
* Available services are proposed with the command Ctrl+Space on content text field.

== Model ==

On the sub section '''Model''' of Capella preferences, it is possible to specify global behavior regarding the management of specific elements.


[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_m2492a832.png|874x633px]]

When &ldquo;'''Reuse of components'''&rdquo; is activated, it activates to enable the reuse of components, creating several Parts from a Type. During a project creation, it activate a performance to reuse components.


[[Image:Images/6.2_Model preferences8.png|500x350px]]


In diagrams, you can use the '''Reuse Components''' palette tool. In Properties, selecting the '''Part''' will provide a way to select an available Type (e.g. Logical Component, Physical Components...).


When &ldquo;'''Multiple inheritance allowed'''&rdquo; is activated, a Class can inherit from several other Classes. Otherwise, it can only have one inheritance ancestor.

When &ldquo;'''Component Non Actor inheritance allowed'''&rdquo; is activated, a Component Non Actor can generalize other Components Non Actor (via Properties View or using Diagram Generalization tools). Otherwise, only Actors are allowed to generalize other Actors.

When &ldquo;'''Multiple deployment allowed'''&rdquo; is activated, one given Behaviour Physical Component can be deployed on several Node Physical Components.


When &ldquo;'''Delete related associations when a class becomes primitive'''&rdquo; is activated, existing associations towards the class which primitive status has changed is deleted automatically. If this option is not activated, then model validation is such cases will raise an error and the end user will be able to manually delete the obsolete association.


'''The three synchronization options define whether Port allocations and delegations are automatically set''' when performing allocations from editors. Activating this option helps improving the productivity.

== Model Change Recorder ==


On the sub section of '''Capella / Model Change Recorder preferences''', it is possible to activate the model changer recording to log technical model or diagram modification .

[[Image:Images/6.2_Model preferences2.png|550x250px]]

You can configure it thanks to features such as the maximum file size or the number of day to keep files.

== Model Validation ==


On the sub section of '''Capella / Model Valdation preferences''', it is possible to manage preferences related to Capella Model Validation by choosing by choosing to enable or disable some validation results.


[[Image:Images/6.2_Model preferences3.png|300x90px]]

== Project Explorer ==


On the sub section of '''Capella / Project Explorer preferences''', when the &ldquo;'''Project'''&rdquo; option is activated, the semantic element &ldquo;Project&rdquo; is displayed (see illustration below). By default, this option is not active.

In order to modify configuration property values located on the Project element (reusable components or not, default values for progress monitoring, etc.).), you can activate temporary this option.

[[Image:Images/6.2_Model preferences.png|440x152px]]


If the preference is activated, the tree will be displayed. For significant model, it can be useful to not display entire trees and use the Regex to find a specific model.


[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_mc875712.png|250x200px]]


== Refinement ==

This section '''Capella / Refinement preferences''' is dedicated to delegation-based refinement of interface sequence diagrams. '''It is not relevant when exploiting Functional Analysis.'''


[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_3df4739.png|640x215px]]


The checkbox &ldquo;'''Allow diagram creation'''&rdquo; specifies whether a diagram shall be automatically created for the target scenario of the refinement.


The checkbox &ldquo;'''Allow diagram opening'''&rdquo; specifies whether the diagram corresponding to the target scenario of the refinement shall be automatically opened or not.


The checkbox &ldquo;'''Perform a pre-validation'''&rdquo; specifies whether the refinement tool shall perform a set of elementary check verifying the source scenario are ready for refinement. It is strongly recommended to activate this option as well as the following one &ldquo;'''Stop Refinement on pre-validation error'''&rdquo;.


== SCM ==

[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_3d6d7194.png|360x136px]]


This section '''Capella / SCM preferences''' is related to the behaviour of Capella regarding the Software Configuration Management tool (e.g. Clearcase). The configuration option allows setting an automatic synchronization delay with the File System.

| 
[[Image:Images/6.2.%20Model%20preferences_html_3c78e109.png|48x48px]]


| 
Activating this configuration option is mandatory when working with Clearcase Dynamic Views, in order to be notified immediately of changes performed by other users.


|}  


== Transfer Viewer ==

On the sub section of '''Capella / Transfer Viewer preferences''', it's recommended for huge models to disable the computation of labels for model elements which appear in the tree, it is also possible to allow the automatic expansion of trees in selection dialogs from Browse button in Properties view and also from Insert/Remove tool in diagram Palette.

[[Image:Images/6.2_Model preferences5.png|625x537px]]

[[Image:Images/6.2_Model preferences6.png|800x500px]]

If the preference is activated, the tree will be displayed. For significant model, it can be useful to not display entire trees.


== Transitions/Generation ==

On the sub section of '''Capella / Transitions/Generation preferences''', it is possible to specify the scope of automatic transitions.


* The radio buttons &ldquo;'''Propagate LC / LA breakdown in physical architecture'''&rdquo; and &ldquo;'''Propagate only leaf LC / LA in physical architecture'''&rdquo; specifies whether the breakdown of Logical Components is kept at physical level or not.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Transit interfaces handled by Components&rdquo;''' specifies whether interfaces are realized from one architecture to another when performing a transition. For example, if this preference is not activated, Physical Components will directly implement / use / provide / require interface located in the system analysis and logical architecture.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Transit allocated Exchange Items while transition of Interfaces, Functions, Components or State Machines&rdquo;''' specifies whether Interfaces, Functions, Components or State Machines transition triggers transition of related Exchange Items (i.e. duplicates Exchange Items from one engineering phase to the following one). If not activated, Interfaces, Functions, Component Exchanges or States/Modes and Transition in the target engineering phase will still refer the Exchange Items located in the previous engineering phase.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Transit Data Types handled by Exchange Items while transition of Exchange Items&rdquo;''' specifies whether Exchange Items transition triggers transition of related Data (i.e. duplicates Data from one engineering phase to the following one). If not activated, Exchange Items in the target engineering phase will still refer the Data elements located in the previous engineering phase.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Transit State Machines owned by a Component while transition of Components&rdquo;''' specifies whether State Machines transition is triggered when performing a Component transition.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Transit Functional elements allocated by an Operational Entity or Operational Actor while their transition&rdquo;''' specifies whether Operational Activities are transformed into System Functions when performing a transition of Operational Entities or Actors.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Include involved elements&rdquo;''' on the Property Values section specifies whether involved elements will be propagated while a transition of Property Values
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Propagate Exchange Items from Functional Exchanges to Function Ports&rdquo;''' specifies whether Exchange Items from Functional Exchanges should be propagated to their related Function Ports during Interface generation.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Create Component Exchange Between provider/requirer ports&rdquo;''' specifies if the Interface generation should create a Component Exchange between each pair of Interface provider/requirer ports if such an exchange does not already exist.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Transit Physical Components to Configuration Items&rdquo;''' specifies whether Physical Components should be transformed into Configuration Items when performing a transition or an initialization from the Physical Architecture to EPBS level.
* The checkbox '''&ldquo;Initialize the creation of related scenario diagram&rdquo;''' specifies whether after transition, the related scenario diagram shall be initialized; this option is disabled by default.
