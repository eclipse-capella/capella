= Commands & User Profiles =

Capella provides a mechanism to disable commands categories and user profile management facility. <u>'''Those preferences are common to all projects in a workspace'''</u> (i.e. they have only one scope: the workspace) even if they are set on a specific project or referenced from a configuration project.
