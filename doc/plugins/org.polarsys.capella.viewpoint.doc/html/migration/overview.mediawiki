== Overview ==

There is two scenarios for migration:

* New Capella version: When a new version of Capella is available, the viewpoint data may need to be migrated.
* New viewpoint version : Within the current version of Capella is available, the viewpoint can be updated to a new version. In this case the viewpoint data may need to be migrated.data may need to be migrated.

Version numbers follow the usual eclipse convention: major.minor.micro.qualifier For example: 1.1.0.20161004114119
When a viewpoint is updated in the platform, if its version major or minor number is upgraded the existing models will need a migration. 

The migration is orchestrated by Capella in both cases.
