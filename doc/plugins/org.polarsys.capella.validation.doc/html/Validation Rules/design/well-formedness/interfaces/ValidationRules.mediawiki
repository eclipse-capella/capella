|DWF_I_23 - Missing/Unused Exchange Items on generated Interfaces 
|-
| colspan="2"|This rule produces Errors for missing or unused Exchange Items on Interfaces generated by the"Interfaces from allocated Functions" modelling accelerator.

An Exchange Item is missing on an Interface if it is allocated on at least one of the Interfaces related Functional or Component Exchanges but not present on the Interface.
