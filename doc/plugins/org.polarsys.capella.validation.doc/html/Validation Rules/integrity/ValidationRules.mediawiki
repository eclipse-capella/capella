This rule ensures that images, used as background of diagram elements, can be found.

Tip: If some cases are detected (validation markers), it is recommended to check the presence of the image and move it in the right folder according to the used expected image path location. Once done, you can restart the validation. If you have still validation markers, then, you can use the "Quick fix" tool to:
<ul>
<li>Select a new image</li>

If you still have validation markers, then use the "Quick fix" tool to select a new image or remove those images from the description. There are three "quick fixes"
<ul>
<li>Remove missing image from rich text description </li>
<li>Select a new image to replace the broken image</li>
<li>Replace all broken path by a new one. '''This "quick fix" will impact the whole model''' and not only the object associated to the marker</li>
