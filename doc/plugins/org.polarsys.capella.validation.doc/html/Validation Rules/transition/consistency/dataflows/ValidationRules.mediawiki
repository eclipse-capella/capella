|TC_DF_02 - Function port refinement check 
|-
| colspan="2"|This rule generates a warning if a port isn't defined in a function or a sub-function realizing the function 
containing the port which has been realized.
A warning can be raised if you have performed a drag and drop of the port to another function but this function is 
not a sub-function of the function containing the port which has been realized and there is no traceability 
link from the current function and the function containing the port which has been realized.
You should add manually a traceability link from the parent function of the realized port and the function 
containing the port which has been realized.

| colspan="2"|This rule checks that a Component Exchange conveying ExchangeItems doesn't convey an ExchangeItem from a previous level whereas it
is realized in the same level than the Component Exchange. Component Exchange should convey the realized ExchangeItem.
A warning can be raised if you have performed a transition of the Component Exchange before performing a transition of the conveyed ExchangeItem. 
You should perform another transition of the Component Exchange from the lower level to use the realized ExchangeItem.

A warning can be raised if you have performed a transition of the FunctionalExchange before performing a transition of the linked ExchangeItem.
You should perform another transition of the FunctionalExchange from the lower level to use the realized ExchangeItem.
