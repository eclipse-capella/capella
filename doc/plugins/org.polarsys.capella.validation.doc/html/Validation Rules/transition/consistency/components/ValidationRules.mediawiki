|TC_DC_01 - Port Allocation 
|-
| colspan="2"|This rule ensures consistency for a port allocation between a ComponentPort and a Functional Port realizing a port allocation from a previous level.
The ComponentPort should realize the ComponentPort of the realized PortAllocation or should be a delegated port of the realizing port.
The FunctionPort should be defined in a function or a sub-function realizing the function containing the port which has been realized.
