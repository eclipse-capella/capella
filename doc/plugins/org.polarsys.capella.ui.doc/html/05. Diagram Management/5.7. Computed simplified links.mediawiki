= Computed Links between Parent Components =

This feature is only available on Logical Architecture Blank [LAB] and Physical Architecture Blank [PAB] diagrams.

Both mentioned diagrams are able to display links between parent components that are defined between their children when children are not displayed on diagrams.

You can show/hide those simplified links by activating/deactivating corresponding filters in the drop down filter menu in LAB and PAB diagrams.
