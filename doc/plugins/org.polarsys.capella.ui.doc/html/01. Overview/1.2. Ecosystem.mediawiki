= Capella Ecosystem =

Capella fits into a wider engineering landscape, as bridges can be developed to:

* Initialize Capella models from upstream engineering outputs (typically coming from Architecture Frameworks such as NAF)
* Confront architecture models to specialty engineering tools (performance, safety, etc.)
* Iteratively populate downstream engineering (subsystems, code generation, etc.)
