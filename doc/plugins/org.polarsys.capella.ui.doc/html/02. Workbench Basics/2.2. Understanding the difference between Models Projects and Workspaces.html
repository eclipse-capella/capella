		<h2 id="Capella_Model">Capella Model</h2>
		<p>When not fragmented, a Capella model consists in two files: one for the model itself and another one for the representations (diagrams and matrices).</p>
		<ul>
			<li>&lt;model name&gt;.capella (semantic model)</li>
			<li>&lt;model name&gt;.aird (representations)</li>
		</ul>

		</p>
		<h2 id="Capella_Project">Capella Project</h2>
		<p>All Eclipse resources are managed in Projects. Projects map to directories on the file system.</p>
		<p>Most of the time in Capella, a Project contains only one Model. A Capella Project thus contains all the resources for a given project (for example fragments when the model is fragmented, images, etc.).</p>

		</p>
		<p>Using the contextual menu on the Project element, one can display the properties of the Project, including its physical location on the file system.</p>

		<p>Project directory on the file system:</p>

		</p>
		<h2 id="Eclipse_Workspace">Eclipse Workspace</h2>
		<p>The workspace is the central hub for the user&rsquo;s file. The workspace allows storing global settings and preferences (in an hidden file called .metadata).</p>
		<p>Projects can be physically located in a Workspace or be referenced through a Workspace. The following scheme illustrates a typical organisation where several users access one Capella Project through different Workspaces.</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>Many alternatives are possible:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A given user could access the same Project through two different 	Workspaces, each one having a specific set of settings and 	preferences.</li>
			<li>A user could mix in his Workspace referenced Projects and locally 	stored ones.</li>
			<li>Etc.</li>
		</ul>
