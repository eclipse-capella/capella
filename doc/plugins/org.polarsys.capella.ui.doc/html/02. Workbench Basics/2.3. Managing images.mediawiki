Capella allows to use images to:
* associate with nodes in diagrams
* insert in the rich text editor

== Selection dialog ==

The image can be selected only from the project in the workspace (nevertheless the project can be either physically located in the workspace or located in other folder in the file system).

== Image in diagram ==

The user clicks on the "Set style to workspace image" button to associate an image to a node

== Image in rich text ==

The user clicks on the "Add image" button to add an image in the rich text.

If an image is pasted from the clipboard into the rich text editor, a new image is created in the '''images''' folder of the project.
There is no base64 encoding.

== Images trouble shooting ==

A special attention should be done about the images to ensure that they are '''properly located''' so that they can be '''properly displayed'''. 
To check that, you can '''start the validation''' and  the [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.validation.doc/html/Validation%20Rules/integrity/ValidationRules.html| I_46 and I_47 constraints]] will check that the images are reachable. 
The quick fix allows to select a new image among the available one in the workspace.

Before fixing the path to the image one by one
* check that the set of images are properly located where it is supposed to
* check that the project containing the images are opened.

Then you can restart the validation to check again the images path
