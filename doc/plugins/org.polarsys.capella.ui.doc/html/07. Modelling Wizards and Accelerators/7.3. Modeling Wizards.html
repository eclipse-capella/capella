		<p>Capella offers a lot of semantic justification means from one engineering phase to another (realization of Functions, Exchanges, Components, etc.). In addition, 
			<b>a generic traceability capability is also provided.</b> 
			<b>Such traceability links can be used to</b> 
			<b>link elements with additional relationships that are not available in Capella</b>. Such traceability relies on the concept of 
			<b>Generic Traces</b>. A dedicated wizard helps creating such Traces, although Capella does not further exploit them.

		<p>The wizard displays all incoming and outgoing traceability for the selected element. On the capture below, built-in Capella relationships are presented in their technical form. The selected element is of type Physical Component and is:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>the target of a realization link coming from a Configuration Item 	(left pane),</li>
			<li>the source of an allocation link towards a Physical Function,</li>
			<li>the source of a realization link towards a Logical Component.</li>

		<p>In this example, we create a Generic Trace between a Physical Component and a System Function (note that this is not a standard Capella relationship). In the Traceability wizard, the link has been added. Double-clicking of on one source or target elements make these this elements the new current element of the wizard. This is what has been done on the wizard shown below: from the System Function, a new incoming Generic Trace exists, coming from the original Physical Component.</p>

		<h3 id="Use_case_context">Use case context</h3>
		<p>Following picture presents the initial context of the use case. The interface diagram displays all elements related to communication concern that are involved in the definition of the four messages defined in the interface scenario.</p>
		<p>
			<img height="313" width="578" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_2fe6c3a7.png"/>

		<h3 id="Reuse_mode">Reuse mode</h3>
		<p>In the palette of the interface scenario, select &ldquo;Sequence Message with Return Branch&rdquo;, and create one message from &ldquo;System&rdquo; to &ldquo;Actor 2&rdquo;. By default, no selectable elements are proposed because there are no complete communications defined between these two components.</p>
		<p>
			<img height="68" width="340" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_20372dd4.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Uncheck the filter option &ldquo;Restrict to existing static communication compatibilities&rdquo;. The wizard proposes now several partial communications:</p>
		<p>
			<img height="189" width="554" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_m1bb276f1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>All these communications are compatible with the message under creation. Set message kind to &ldquo;Asynchronous call&rdquo;. Selectable communications change to satisfy compatibility. Both communication with interfaces disappear (&ldquo;method1&rdquo; and &ldquo;method2&rdquo;) and value of sender link protocols switch to &ldquo;ASYNCHRONOUS&rdquo; for both communications with CLs.</p>
		<p>
			<img height="125" width="553" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_mf319315.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Go back to &ldquo;Synchronous call&rdquo; value. Select &ldquo;method1&rdquo; under interface &ldquo;Interface3&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;. A new message is displayed in the interface scenario. In the interface diagram, new Use link between &ldquo;System&rdquo; and &ldquo;Interface3&rdquo; has been created to complete communication by interfaces.</p>

			<img height="235" width="299" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_m6dc3155c.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Try to create another message with return between the same components. We can notice that the wizard proposes both &ldquo;method1&rdquo; and &ldquo;method2&rdquo; by default with the filter option &ldquo;Restrict to existing static communication compatibilities&rdquo; activated since there exists now a complete communication by interfaces between this pair of components.</p>
		<p>In the palette of the interface scenario, select &ldquo;Sequence Message&rdquo; and create one message from &ldquo;Actor 2&rdquo; to &ldquo;System&rdquo;. Deactivates filter option &ldquo;Restrict to existing static communication compatibilities&rdquo; and select the communication with CLs under &ldquo;system&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>
			<img height="140" width="554" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_3b8ac738.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Set the name of the interface to &ldquo;MyInterface&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;Finish&rdquo; to create the message. In the interface diagram, deactivate the filter &ldquo;Hide technical Interface&rdquo; and use the &ldquo;insert/remove interface&rdquo; tool in the palette to display &ldquo;MyInterface&rdquo;. Use and implements links has been created so that a communication with technical interface &ldquo;MyInterface&rdquo; is established between &ldquo;Actor 2&rdquo; and &ldquo;System&rdquo;. Communication with CLs has been also completed (creation of the &ldquo;SEND&rdquo; link).</p>

			<img height="301" width="424" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_6b0bb32.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Try to create another message without return between Actor2 and System. Wizard provides now two possible communications, one under a technical interface whose the name is hidden. Deactivate filter option &ldquo;Hide the Name of Technical Interfaces&rdquo; to see it. Activate the filter option &ldquo;Show other Exchange Items&rdquo;. Three new items appears.</p>
		<p>
			<img height="216" width="553" border="0" src="Images/7.3.%20Modeling%20Wizards_html_1052ecae.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>In creation options, activate both options &ldquo;Create Port Realization instead of direct Implementation&rdquo; and &ldquo;Create Communication Links&rdquo;, select &ldquo;method1&rdquo; under package &ldquo;Interfaces&rdquo; and click on &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;.</p>
		<p>

		</p>
		<p>In the interface diagram, use the &ldquo;insert/remove interface&rdquo; tool in the palette to display the newly created interface &ldquo;Actor 2_to_System&rdquo;. Two new communications has been created: one with new interface &ldquo;Actor 2_to_System&rdquo; and one with CLs involving Exchange Item &ldquo;method1&rdquo;. Notice that the created CL that plays the role of sender link is asynchronous.</p>

		<h3 id="Create_mode">Create mode</h3>
		<p>Create a message without return from &ldquo;Actor1&rdquo; to &ldquo;Actor2&rdquo;. Set the wizard in creation mode (check &ldquo;Create a new exchange item&rdquo;). Set the name of the Exchange Item as &ldquo;data&rdquo; and set its Exchange Mechanism as &ldquo;Shared data&rdquo;.</p>

		<p>By default, the selected interface is &ldquo;Interface3&rdquo;. The user can choose another one (in that case among &ldquo;Interface1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Interface2&rdquo;) by using the browse button. Validate the creation by clicking on &ldquo;Finish&rdquo;. In the interface diagram, the new Exchange Item &ldquo;data&rdquo; has been allocated to &ldquo;Interface3&rdquo;. Display &ldquo;data&rdquo; in the diagram. Following pictures present the final state of interface diagram and interface scenario for the use case.</p>
