= Contextual Allocations =

A specific dialog can be called contextually to one or several elements in order to manage their allocations to other elements.

Possible allocations:


* '''Operational Activities to Operational Entities / Actors''' 	(allocation relationship)
* '''Functions to Actor / System / Components''' (allocation 	relationship)
* '''Exchange Items to Interfaces''' (reference relationship)
* '''Functional Exchanges to Component Exchanges''' (allocation 	relationship)
* '''Physical Component Parts to Physical Component Parts''' 	(deployment relationship)

== Example: Allocation of Activities and Functions to Entities, Actors, Components ==

Most of the time, allocating a Function to a Component is achieved through an architecture diagram or through the Component Editor.

The allocation can also be performed the other way round: by opening a contextual dialog on a Function or Activity, all possible Components proposed (according to the current engineering phase: Entities, Actors, System, Logical Components, Physical Components). This command is available both from the Project Explorer and the Diagrams.


One of the main advantage of this contextual allocation dialog is that is allows selecting several Functions / Activities at once and allocate them to the selected element.

The possible choices are then proposed.
