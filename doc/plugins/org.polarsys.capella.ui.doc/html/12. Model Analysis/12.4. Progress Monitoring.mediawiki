== Steps for Creating Project-Specific Progress Status ==

Configure the Capella browser so that the ''Project'' element is displayed (see ''Project Explorer ''section of Preferences).


<center>[[Image:Images/12.4.%20Progress%20Monitoring_html_4f09dd6.png|475x445px]]</center>


Using the contextual menu on this ''Project'' element, create a new ''EnumerationPropertyType'' element and name it &quot;ProgressStatus&quot;.


<center>[[Image:Images/12.4.%20Progress%20Monitoring_html_73c7c6df.png|335x385px]]</center>


Under &quot;ProgressStatus&quot;, create as many ''EnumerationPropertyLiteral'' elements as needed. Rename these literals with the appropriate values using ''F2'' in the project explorer or using the dedicated editors.

It is recommended to hide again the ''Project'' element in the project explorer so that end-users will not be tempted to modify it


== Setting Progress Status on Elements ==

To tag elements with a given progress status, use from the contextual menu of any element the command Progress Monitoring -> Set Progress.

    It is possible to only propagate on sub representations without propagate on model elements by selecting "Do not propagate to Model Elements".
