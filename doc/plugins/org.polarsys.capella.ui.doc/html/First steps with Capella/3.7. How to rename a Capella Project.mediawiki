= How to rename a Capella Project? =

Either the session is closed or the session is open, you can rename the project.


The following sequence must be respected:

# On the '''project''', type '''F2''' (or contextual menu &ldquo;Rename&rdquo;): this action will rename the folder of the project and modify the &ldquo;.project&rdquo; file inside this folder. It will rename also the Project root element of the model and the System Engineering element. If the project contains images referenced in the diagram, the paths also to those images in the aird will be updated.
# On the &ldquo;'''.capella'''&rdquo; file, type '''F2''' (or contextual menu &ldquo;Rename&rdquo;): this action will rename the &ldquo;.capella&rdquo; file and update all references from the &ldquo;.aird&rdquo; files to the &ldquo;.capella&rdquo; file.
# On the &ldquo;'''.aird'''&rdquo; file, type '''F2''' (or contextual menu &ldquo;Rename&rdquo;): this action will rename the &ldquo;.aird&rdquo; file and also the associated &ldquo;.afm&rdquo; file and update all references in the &ldquo;.aird&rdquo; files to the &ldquo;.afm&rdquo; file.
# On the &ldquo;'''.melodyconnector'''&rdquo; file, type '''F2''' (or contextual menu &ldquo;Rename&rdquo;): this action will rename the &ldquo;.melodyconnector&rdquo; file.

The same process can be applied on Library projects.

If you rename a Library project, all the references to this library will be lost. Libraries renaming must be done very carefully.

About images used in diagrams and in rich text editor<br/>

In the same way, assuming that a referencing Capella project or a Library project is using images that are located in a referenced project (Capella project, a Library project or any project) then renaming the referenced project will break the images (images will not be seen anymore) in the referencing project.

More information about the [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.validation.doc/html/Validation%20Rules/integrity/ValidationRules.html| validation for images]] or about the  [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.ui.doc/html/First%20steps%20with%20Capella/3.5.%20How%20to%20migrate%20Capella%20projects.html#Special_attention_to_image_used_in_the_project|Capella project migration for images.]]

Note that the images used in the renamed project and located in the renamed project will be properly migrated and will be properly displayed.
