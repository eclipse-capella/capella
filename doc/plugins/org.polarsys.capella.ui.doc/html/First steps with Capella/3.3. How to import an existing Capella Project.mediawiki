<li>In order to import a Capella project, you need to have the same version as the one used to create / edit the model.</li>
<li>If you have a more recent version, a migration of the project is required.</li>
<li>In any case, a Capella project cannot be open with an older version. If a migration is performed, it will not be possible to open the model with older version anymore.</li>
<li>Finally, you also need to be careful about the extensions (add-ons / viewpoints) used to edit the model.</li>
<li>Some extensions enrich Capella with new concepts or new graphical representations. In this case, it is required to have the same extensions installed in order to be able to open the model.</li>
<li>If not the case, it is possible to perform a model detachment. This detachment will irreversibly delete all the information about the missing extensions.</li>

The archive of the Project will be extracted inside the Workspace (i.e. the physical location of the imported will be the same as the location of the Workspace).


When choosing &ldquo;Select Root Directory&rdquo;, the following dialog box opens:


[[Image:Images/3.3.%20How%20to%20import%20an%20existing%20Melody%20Advance%20Project_html_1e9ba319.png]]


For each project in the selected directory, one can select whether the Project should be copied within the Workspace or not.


When choosing the copy option:


* The original Project will be duplicated in the file system
* Modifications will be applied on the copy inside the Workspace and 	not on the original Project files (see documentation about 	relationships between Projects and Workspaces).

Click on Finish. The selected projects are opened in the current workspace.
