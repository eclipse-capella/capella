
= How to install Capella and Addons ? =
== Capella Installation ==
=== Prerequisites Needed for Install ===
For a successful installation of Capella, your computer must meet the following recommended requirements:
  
*  64 bit computer running Windows 7/8/10, Windows Server 2008/2012/2016
*  An unzip software such as 7Zip or equivalent
*  2 GHz processor
*  4 Go RAM
*  15 GB of available hard disk space

Capella requires a Java Runtime Environment (version 1.8 or later) installed in the computer: Recommended version is JRE 8u121
=== Capella Installation Procedure ===
Before starting the installation, the target location of Capella must be cleaned:

# The previous Capella version must be correctly uninstalled (See related section)
# All manual patches/extensions must be removed    
# Download Capella and extract it in a given directory 
   
'''Note''' : '''See Restriction''' 
=== Verification Installation Procedure ===
The Capella installation is successful  if the archive extraction finished without errors.

*  The Capella folder should contain two folders:
** eclipse: the Capella modeling workbench with the .exe of Capella 
** samples: the sample models

=== Multi-user installation ===
Capella provides different strategies for supporting multi-user installs. Each strategy is deployed based on three important locations: 
* '''The install area''': the place where Capella is installed.
* '''The configuration area''': the place where Capella stores runtime meta-data (such as the set of installed plugins).
* '''The instance area''': the place where users store data.

==== Strategy 1 - Private install ====
Single user install. This is the most basic configuration. Nothing needs to be set up.

===== Particularities: =====
* The configuration area is by default the '''configuration''' directory in the Capella installation folder.

===== Setup: =====
* Enabled by default, nothing to do.

==== Strategy 2 - Shared install ====
Multi user shared install.

===== Particularities: =====
* The users share the same install area, but manage themselves the configuration area. 
* The users must clean their configuration area each time the set of plugins is modified.

===== Setup: =====
* Either in '''eclipse.ini''' or '''config.ini''' file, add the argument '''osgi.configuration.area=@user.home/path/to/user/configuration''' .

==== Strategy 3 - Shared configuration ====
Multi user shared configuration install.

===== Particularities: =====
* The users share the same install area and a common configuration area (called master configuration area), and have '''read only''' rights.
* The system administrator must initialize the master configuration area (by default the '''configuration''' directory in the Capella installation folder). 

===== Prerequisites: =====
*  The administrator must do the setup operations with '''administrator rights'''!

===== Setup: =====
* For normal users: In '''eclipse.ini''' add the argument '''osgi.configuration.area=@user.home/path/to/user/configuration''' . 
* For administrator: create a '''admin.ini''' file, having the same content as '''eclipse.ini''' in which the line  '''osgi.configuration.area''' is removed, and launch Capella referencing the '''admin.ini''' file.


==== Strategy 4 - Multi-level shared configuration ====
Multi level user shared configuration install.

===== Particularities: =====
* This is similar to Strategy 3, except that instead of sharing the master configuration area, we can share intermediate configuration areas.
* Each configuration area is suitable for a specific working environment (e.g. with different plugins install). 

===== Setup: =====
* The system administrator initializes the master configuration area (by default the '''configuration''' directory in the Capella installation folder). 

* The working environment administrators initialize their local shared configurations by adding the argument '''-Dosgi.configuration.area=path/to/shared/configuration''' to their own custom '''.ini''' file. 

* Users configure their '''eclipse.ini''' to point to the shared configuration area of the working environment that they belong to, as follows:
** '''-Dosgi.sharedConfiguration.area=path/to/shared/configuration'''
** '''-Dosgi.configuration.cascaded=true'''

=== Workaround to open the Help Content when there is problem with the browser ===
Sometimes due to security policy, the web browser has problem on opening local host web pages. This is the case of the Help Content page when it is accessed via the 127.0.0.1 IP address. Here are 2 possible workarounds to overcome this problem:
*  In the URL, replace 127.0.0.1 by localhost.
*  Copy the URL and paste it in another web browser without restriction.

== Addons Installation ==
There are 3 ways to install addons :
# Simple installation 
** Install the addons directly in the dropins folder of Capella :
## Unzip the archive of the addon in your Capella "dropins" directory
# External installation 
** Install the addons in an external directory and configure Capella to get them from this specific directory :
## Unzip the archive of the addon in a directory
## Add -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=<myAddonsDirectory> at the end of the eclipse.ini file (after -vm)
# Multiple contexts installation 
** Create several contexts with specific addons and allow users to launch Capella on one or another context :
### Create contexts directories (copy eclipse.ini from Capella and unzip the needed addons in a dropins folder). 
### For each context, change the eclipse.ini file as follows:

[[Image:Images/3.9.%20How%20to%20install%20Cappela%20and%20Addons_Multicontext_Install.png|588x330px]]
* For Context_A, add the following lines at the end of the eclipse.ini file (afer -vm)-(Example)
{| border="1"
|-
|  
| 
* Dropins location in Context_A directory
-Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=D:\CapellaContexts\Context_A\dropins
* Configuration location for Context_A in the user's specific directory
-Dosgi.configuration.area=@user.home/.../Capella/Context_A/configuration
* Default workspace location for Context_A in user's specific directory
-Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/../Capella/Context_A/workspace
 
|}
* For Context_B, add the following lines at the end of the eclipse.ini file (afer -vm)-(Example)
{| border="1"
|-
|  
| 
* Dropins location in Context_A directory
-Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=D:\CapellaContexts\Context_B\dropins
* Configuration location for Context_A in user's specific directory
-Dosgi.configuration.area=@user.home/.../Capella/Context_B/configuration
* Default workspace location for Context_B in user's specific directory
-Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/../Capella/Context_B/workspace
|}
* Create shortcuts to launch Capella using the eclipse.ini file stored in the expected context:
** For context A: <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>\eclipse\eclipse.exe --launcher.ini D:\CapellaContexts\Context_A\eclipse.ini
** For context B: <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>\eclipse\eclipse.exe --launcher.ini D:\CapellaContexts\Context_B\eclipse.ini
The extensions for Capella requires the installation of the following software:

* Capella : For the Capella installation, please refer to this guide

'''Note''':Make sure that the addon/extension is compatible with your current version of Capella.
=== Addons ===
The installation procedure is the same for all addons.   
==== As Dropin ====
To manually install your addon:

*  Download the addon as a dropin
*  Extract the contents of the downloaded archive into <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>/eclipse/dropins directory
Check that the extraction process has finished without error.
*  Start Capella

- Make sure that the installed addon as dropin has a valid structure. The structure is similar to:
* '''<addon name>\eclipse\plugins\*''' 
* '''<addon name>\eclipse\features\* '''

- The structure is different from the one of an '''update site'''. The '''update site''' does have the '''artifacts.jar''' and '''content.jar''' which might cause problems for installing a plug-in.
 
|}

==== As Update Site ====
*  Download the addon as an update site
*  Start Capella
*  Open Help using the menu toolbar
*  Select Install New Software
*  A wizard is displayed
*  Click on Add button
*  Click on Archive... button
*  Select the downloaded addon archive and press OK
*  Give it a name and press OK
*  Click on Select All button then Next
*  Agree and click on Finish
*  Restart when prompted

'''Verification''' 

The following procedure for verifying the successful installation of addons, assumes that Capella is well installed and fully functional.

'''Plugins Verification'''
*  Start Capella with the option '''-clean'''. It forces the application to clear the cached data and to rebuild its configuration after installing a plug-in.
*  Open '''Help''' using the menu toolbar
*  Select '''About Capella'''
*  Select '''Installation Details'''
*  Select '''Plugins''' tab
*  Scroll down the list
* Check that the plugins that correspond to the add-on are displayed.
* Open '''Error Log''' view and verify there is not any error message relating to the installed add-on.
* If no problem happens, remove this '''-clean''' parameter to avoid starting performance issues for next times.

- After updating the installation of Capella, do not forget to restart the application with the option '''-clean'''. Remove this option for the next times to avoid starting performance issues.

- Do not forget to switch to a new workspace when the configuration is modified, since some information are cached by Eclipse (Java version, etc...).

Capella is based on Eclipse: folder hierarchy and namespace of Capella and Eclipse plugins are quite long. Because of Windows folder path restriction, avoid entering a long installation location. 

In case the path is too long, some files can not be opened by Capella and this will cause errors. Since the extraction will raise an error you should delete the partially extracted files and re-extract it.

Example in the [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.ui.doc/html/04.%20User%20Interface/4.06.%20Properties%20View.html#Description_Section |Description Section ]].

The limit is '''115''' characters in the path of the Capella directory to the eclipse folder: <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>/eclipse.

 
'''Note: the "space" character is counted like three characters (%20)'''.
