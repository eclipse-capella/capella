== Overview ==
 
Capella provides Search &amp; Replace functionalities on model elements that follow the Eclipse Search &amp; Replace convention. Several options are provided to enable fine grained Search &amp; Replace on Capella models.
 
To open the Search &amp; Replace window dialog, go to the '''Search''' toolbar (Ctrl + H).

== Search Options ==
<br>
 
=== Model Element Scope ===
 
Model element scope can be customized in the '''Search For''' section which allows us to specify the granularity  of content to search for:
* Search in specific features of selected meta-classes
* Search in diagram (attributes of diagrams or notes)
* Filter criteria: abstract and semantic

On the left side of the '''Search For''' section, the meta-classes can be selected, the right panel will be updated with the union of the attributes of the selected meta-classes.
We have the option to apply the default search for granularity by pressing the '''Restore Defaults''' buttons.

=== Find Pattern ===
 
The find text is used to match model elements before performing the search. Several options can be chosen:

 
* '''Case sensitive'''.
* '''Regular expression''': enables the use of * and ? in the find expression 	i.e. * matches zero or more characters and ? matches zero or one 	character.
* '''Whole word''': only model elements that starts by the find 	expressions (e.g. &ldquo;ABC DEF&rdquo; matches &ldquo;ABC DEF GHI&rdquo; 	but not &ldquo;ABC DEFG&rdquo;)

'''Note:''' selecting &ldquo;''Wildcards&rdquo;'' options disables &ldquo;''Whole expression''&rdquo; option.

=== Search Scope ===
 
The Capella Search dialog provides a section to define the search scope which only concerns opened sessions:
* The '''Workspace''' scope applies on all projects in the workspace
* The '''Selected model elements''' scope applies on selected elements
* The '''Enclosing project''' scope applies on current project

=== Search and Replace Operations ===
 
From the Capella Search dialog we have the option to fill a text pattern and then perform:
* '''Search''': pressing the search button will close the current dialog and will display the search results in a separate window.
* '''Replace''' will open a dialog box that will have the possibility to enter a replacement text pattern.

=== Search Result ===
 
When you perform a search in Capella, the matching model elements according to the selected criteria in the search dialog will be found. The result will be displayed in separate window as below, following the Eclipse Search &amp; Result conventions.

The Capella search result window enables the possibility to replace a text pattern, a single occurrence or replace all the occurrences.
