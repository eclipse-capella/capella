== How to Put a Model Element in the Fast Linker? ==

There are several ways to send elements in the Fast Linker:


* Drag &amp; Drop from viewers (Project Explorer, 	Semantic Browser),
* Contextual menu (Viewers and Diagrams), with the &ldquo;Send to Fast 	Linker View&rdquo; command,

* F6 shortcut (Viewers and Diagrams).

== Link Creation Procedure ==

The following things happen when the user put an element in the Fast Linker:


* If the Fast Linker is empty, it checks whether this element can be 	part of a link (as source or target),
** If no link is possible, the Fast Linker rejects the model element,
** If at least one link is possible, the Fast Linker accepts the model 		element and it becomes visible in the Fast Linker view,

* If the Fast Linker already contains one element, it gets the links 	between both elements (whatever which is source or target),
** If no link is possible, the Fast Linker rejects the model element 		(the first model element is leaved untouched),
** If one link is possible, it is created,
** If several links are possible, a menu is displayed to allow the 		user to make a choice:

* Once a link is created, a message is added in the Information View:

* If a model element is once again put in the Fast Linker, the 	procedure restarts as if the Fast Linker was empty.

== Additional Features ==

The Fast Linker offers some features to ease its usage:


* A clear command ([[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m46b0819d.png|16x16px]]),
* A pin command ([[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m6358d111.png|30x17px]]) 	allowing to keep an element in the Fast Linker in order to create 	several links involving it,
** There is two ways to pin an element:
*** Select it in the Fast Linker view and then click on the pin button,
*** Use the drop down menu of the pin button and select the element to pin:<br>[[Image:Images/4.11.%20FastLinker_html_m3bb8b649.png|242x223px]]<br>
** The pinned element is displayed in bold,
** The same procedures can be used to unpin a pinned element


== Multiple Selection ==

The Fast Linker view supports multiple sources and multiple targets to create links between each couple of source and target when possible.

* This feature 					is not yet implemented for every link but works 					with classes associations and generalizations.
* Note 					that multiple sources can have only one target for a 					generalization link.
