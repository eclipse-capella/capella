The Activity Explorer provides a methodological access to all key activities in Capella. The Activity Explorer is displayed automatically each time a Capella model is opened. It can also be launched with the contextual menu.

The Activity Explorer is the main interaction point with a Capella model.

After selecting one of the Arcadia perspective, it allows to:<br>
<ul>
<li>create new diagrams depending on the type of activity the user want to address</li>
<li>and open the already existing diagrams</li>
</ul>

There is also a special tab dedicated to the Documentation of the project. You can use it for multiple purposes, e.g. to provide a guidance to model readers on where to start and how to navigate the model for let's say a review of it.

== Customization ==
Despite Capella comes with a strong methodological background, it is often necessary to customize the modelling strategy and objectives for a given system. It is therefore possible to customize the activities appearing on the Activity Explorer, using below Capella Preferences.
