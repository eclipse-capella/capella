= Capella Overview / Activity Browser =

The Activity Browser provides a methodological access to all key activities in Capella. The Activity Browser is displayed automatically each time a Capella model is opened. It can also be launched with the contextual menu.

The Activity Browser embeds a documentation tab. This tab displays the current description of the System Engineering root element.

As 				descriptions of elements in Capella can embed html links 				towards specific elements of the model and towards diagrams, it 				is a good idea to use the description tab of the Activity Browser 				to create a kind of reader guide for the current model. The idea 				is to explain the model organization, provide fast access to key 				diagrams, focus on specific areas, etc.

Despite Capella comes with a strong methodological background, it is often necessary to customize the modelling strategy and objectives for a given system. It is therefore possible to customize the sections appearing on the Activity Browser, using the Capella Preferences (see specific documentation).
