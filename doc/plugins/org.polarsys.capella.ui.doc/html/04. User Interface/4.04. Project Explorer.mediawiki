== Opening, Visualizing and Closing a Model ==
 
When not fragmented, a Capella model is composed of one file containing the model elements (the semantic model) and one or more AIRD files containing the representations (diagrams and matrices).

 
It can also contain additional resources such as images.

 
<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_m50c8ab23.png|213x200px]]</center>

 
Double-clicking on the AIRD file opens the model. While the AIRD file technically contains the diagrams, once opened, it also shows the hierarchical view of the semantic model.

 
This hierarchy represents how the model elements are organized in terms of containment. Diagrams attached to a specific element are located under this element.

An additional folder shows all diagrams sorted by categories.

 
<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_301b63e9.png|346x421px]]</center>

 
Optionally, another folder displaying diagrams sorted by resources is available. Viewing diagrams sorted by resources can be helpful when models are fragmented or when several AIRD files are referencing a unique semantic model. as a folder in which diagrams are sorted by categories.

Clicking on &ldquo;Customize View&rdquo; opens a dialog where &ldquo;Representations per category&rdquo; can be hidden.

On an opened AIRD file, the contextual menu allows to close the model, activate or deactivate viewpoints.

Saving the model can be performed from the toolbar or using the CTRL+S shortcut.

The * character in 				front of the project explorer View title indicates the model has 				changed since the last save. One says the model is in a &laquo; dirty &raquo; 				state.

== Customizing the Content of the Project Explorer ==
 
It is possible to filter some of the elements displayed in the hierarchical view of the model. This can be particularly useful for hiding &ldquo;technical&rdquo; model elements such as transformation links, etc.

<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_dd6dd4d.png|239x420px]]</center>

 
For example, when masking Trace elements, the difference is the following. The Project Explorer get clearer when &ldquo;technical&rdquo; elements are hidden. Dedicated Properties View and Diagrams usually allow to see in a more ergonomic way the same information.

Note that the Component and Functional Exchanges are hidden by default with Capella.

 
== Commands of the Contextual Menu ==
 
In the hierarchical view of the model, a contextual menu allows launching all kinds of commands (model validation, model transformation, creation of diagrams, etc.).

 
The functionality of each of these applicative commands is described in other sections of this documentation.

 
<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_5ec4b59f.png|479x436px]]</center>


The &ldquo;Sort Content&rdquo; command alphabetically sorts the children of an element taking into account capitalized letters and spaces in element name.


The &ldquo;Sort Selection&rdquo; command sorts the list of selected elements which have the same parent and the same type.


<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_Sort%20Selection.png|627x324px]]</center>

 
The &ldquo;Add Capella Element&rdquo; command creates new semantic elements.

 
<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_m2bcc91e2.png|627x324px]]</center>

 
The &ldquo;New Diagram / Table&rdquo; command creates new diagrams or matrices.

 
<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_40cc432b.png|627x194px]]</center>

 
The &ldquo;Go To&rdquo; command provides a quick navigation shortcut towards related elements. For example, the type of a property, the allocated functions of a component, etc.

The contextual menu on a diagram allows to rename or clone an existing diagram (a new diagram is initiated with the same content and layout, which can be very helpful).

== Synchronization with other Views ==
 
Some other views, such as the Semantic Browser and the Properties view, are automatically updated regarding the element that is currently selected in the Project Explorer.

         
{| border="1"
|-
| 
<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_3c78e109.png|48x48px]]</center>

 
| 
From 				the Diagram Editor, the Semantic Browser and the Information 				View, typing F8 on a specific element instantaneously selects 				this element in the Project Explorer.

 
|}  
== Search Field ==
 
A research field based on regular expressions is available on the top of the Project Explorer. It is convenient to quickly locate elements in the hierarchy, based on just a part of their name.

<center>[[Image:Images/4.04.%20Project%20Explorer_html_3c78e109.png|48x48px]]</center>

 
| 
Clicking 				on the small magnifier next to the search field allows searching 				not only in names but also in descriptions.

A wildcard character can be used to substitute 				for any other character or characters in a string.

 
* : the asterisk character substitutes for 				zero or more of the characters. For example, ab*c 				matches &quot;ac&quot;, &quot;abc&quot;, &quot;abbc&quot;, 				&quot;abbbc&quot;, and so on.

 
? 				: the question mark substitutes for exactly one character. For 				example, colo?r matches only &quot;colour&quot; 				and not &quot;color&quot;.
