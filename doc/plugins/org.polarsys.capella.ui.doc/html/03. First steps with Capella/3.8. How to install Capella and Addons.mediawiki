== Capella Installation ==
=== Prerequisites Needed for Install ===
For a successful installation of Capella, your computer must meet the following recommended requirements:
  
*  64 bit computer running Windows 7/8/10, Windows Server 2008/2012/2016
*  An unzip software such as 7Zip or equivalent
*  2 GHz processor
*  4 Go RAM
*  15 GB of available hard disk space

Capella requires a Java Runtime Environment (version 1.8 or later) installed in the computer: Recommended version is JRE 8u121
=== Capella Installation Procedure ===
Before starting the installation, the target location of Capella must be cleaned:

# The previous Capella version must be correctly uninstalled (See related section)
# All manual patches/extensions must be removed    
# Download Capella and extract it in a given directory 
   
'''Note''' : '''See Restriction''' 
=== Verification Installation Procedure ===
The Capella installation is successful  if the archive extraction finished without errors.

*  The Capella folder should contain two folders:
** eclipse: the Capella modeling workbench with the .exe of Capella 
** samples: the sample models
== Addons Installation ==
There are 3 ways to install addons :
# Simple installation 
** Install the addons directly in the dropins folder of Capella :
## Unzip the archive of the addon in your Capella "dropins" directory
# External installation 
** Install the addons in an external directory and configure Capella to get them from this specific directory :
## Unzip the archive of the addon in a directory
## Add -Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=<myAddonsDirectory> at the end of the eclipse.ini file (after -vm)
# Multiple contexts installation 
** Create several contexts with specific addons and allow users to launch Capella on one or another context :
### Create contexts directories (copy eclipse.ini from Capella and unzip the needed addons in a dropins folder). 
### For each context, change the eclipse.ini file as follows:

[[Image:Images/3.8.%20How%20to%20install%20Cappela%20and%20Addons_Multicontext_Install.png|588x330px]]
* For Context_A, add the following lines at the end of the eclipse.ini file (afer -vm)-(Example)
{| border="1"
|-
|  
| 
* Dropins location in Context_A directory
-Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=D:\CapellaContexts\Context_A\dropins
* Configuration location for Context_A in the user's specific directory
-Dosgi.configuration.area=@user.home/.../Capella/Context_A/configuration
* Default workspace location for Context_A in user's specific directory
-Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/../Capella/Context_A/workspace
 
|}
* For Context_B, add the following lines at the end of the eclipse.ini file (afer -vm)-(Example)
{| border="1"
|-
|  
| 
* Dropins location in Context_A directory
-Dorg.eclipse.equinox.p2.reconciler.dropins.directory=D:\CapellaContexts\Context_B\dropins
* Configuration location for Context_A in user's specific directory
-Dosgi.configuration.area=@user.home/.../Capella/Context_B/configuration
* Default workspace location for Context_B in user's specific directory
-Dosgi.instance.area.default=@user.home/../Capella/Context_B/workspace
|}
* Create shortcuts to launch Capella using the eclipse.ini file stored in the expected context:
** For context A: <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>\eclipse\eclipse.exe --launcher.ini D:\CapellaContexts\Context_A\eclipse.ini
** For context B: <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>\eclipse\eclipse.exe --launcher.ini D:\CapellaContexts\Context_B\eclipse.ini

After updating the installation of Capella, do not forget to restart the application.

 
Do not forget to switch to a new workspace when the configuration is modified, since some information are cached by Eclipse (Java version, etc...).

Capella is based on Eclipse: folder hierarchy and namespace of Capella and Eclipse plugins are quite long. Because of Windows folder path restriction, avoid entering a long installation location. 

In case the path is too long, some files can not be opened by Capella and this will cause errors. Since the extraction will raise an error you should delete the partially extracted files and re-extract it.

Example in the [[../help/topic/org.polarsys.capella.ui.doc/html/04.%20User%20Interface/4.06.%20Properties%20View.html#Description_Section |Description Section ]].

The limit is '''115''' characters in the path of the Capella directory to the eclipse folder: <CAPELLA_INSTALLATION_DIR>/eclipse.
