	<p>
		Designing large systems often involves repetitive modeling tasks.
		Certain modeling principles, usually based on business expertise, have
		to be applied in different parts of the model under construction, or
		reused throughout different models. It is interesting to make these
		modeling principles or'<i> patterns</i>' explicit so that they can be
		<b>applied</b> in models.

		In a nutshell, a pattern can be <b>created</b> (1) from a subset of a
		model and stored in a <b>catalog</b>. It can then be applied somewhere
		in the same model or in a different one. This gives birth to a new <b>instance</b>
		(2) of the pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
		Patterns and instances have their own separate life cycles, but they
		can be synchronized at any time. Concretely, it is possible to check
		that an instance still <b>conforms</b> to its pattern. If not, the
		instance can be <b>updated</b> (3) according to the last version of
		the pattern. Conversely, the instance can also be used for <b>updating
			the pattern</b>, thus allowing other instances to be updated accordingly.
