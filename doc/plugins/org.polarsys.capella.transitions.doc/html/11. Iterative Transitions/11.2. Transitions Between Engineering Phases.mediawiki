
= Iterative Transitions Between Engineering Phases =

== Overview ==

An automated transition should not always include all modeling elements from a phase to a lower phase.


To offer flexibility to the user and to allow performing transition of specific parts from a phase into a lower phase, modeling concepts have been categorized into activities, which are:


* Data transition
* Exchange Item transition
* State machine transition
* Interface transition
* Operation Activity transition
* Operational Entity transition
* Functional transition
* Actor transition
* System to Logical System transition
* LC / LA to PC / PA transition
* Port transition

An activity is (of course) linked to others activities but categorizing modelling elements into these activities defines entry points for the user to trigger the automated transition.


== Transition Entry Points ==

This section provides a simplified version of transition graph for each entry points to trigger transition and determines scope of transition for these entry points.


=== Data Transition ===

The transition is available at:


* '''Operational Analysis to System Analysis''',
* '''System Analysis to Logical Architecture''',
* '''Logical Architecture to Physical Architecture'''.

The involved element types are:

The transition tool performed on data should follow this sub-graph:


All data contained into a package is transitioned into the targeted phase.


=== Exchange Item Transition ===

The involved element types are:

Data types defined in a phase can be used in a lower phase. According to preference '''Transit Data Types handled by Exchange Items while transition of Exchange Items''', perform a transition of Exchange items can also trigger a transition of related datatypes. If a related datatype is not transitioned, exchange item will be linked to the data type from the upper phase.

|}  
=== State Machine Transition ===

The involved element types are:

According to preference '''Transit State Machines owned by a Component while transition of Components''', perform a transition of Components/actors can also trigger a transition of related State Machines.

Exchange items defined in a phase can be used in a lower phase. According to preference '''Transit allocated Exchange Items while transition of Interfaces, Functions, Components or State Machines''', perform a transition of State Machines can also trigger a transition of conveyed exchange items. If a conveyed exchange item of States/Modes or State Transitions is not transitioned, the States/Modes or State Transitions will convey the exchange item from the upper phase. 
|}  
=== Interface Transition ===

The transition is available at:

* '''System Analysis to Logical Architecture'''
* '''Logical Architecture to Physical Architecture'''

The involved element types are:

State/Modes are owned by Components/Actors and can&rsquo;t be used between phases. Perform a Functional Transition without having triggered a State Machine transition will lose links between functions and defined state modes. After having transitioned state machine, a new functional transition will set missing links to mode/states into transitioned functions.

[[Image:Images/11.2.%20Transitions%20Between%20Engineering%20Phases_html_2ce7f015.png|585x309px]]


Two kind of transition should be available: Breakdown Strategy and Leaf Strategy


==== Breakdown Strategy ====

Propagate the logical component/actor breakdown in physical architecture


==== Leaf Strategy ====

Propagate only leaf logical components/actors in physical architecture (this strategy seems inconsistent with a system modelling allowing reuse of component/actor through parts).
