		<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
		<p>An automated transition should not always include all modeling elements from a phase to a lower phase.</p>
		<p>To offer flexibility to the user and to allow performing transition of specific parts from a phase into a lower phase, modeling concepts have been categorized into activities, which are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Data transition</li>
			<li>Exchange Item transition</li>
			<li>State machine transition</li>
			<li>Interface transition</li>
			<li>Operation Activity transition</li>
			<li>Operational Entity transition</li>
			<li>Functional transition</li>
			<li>Actor transition</li>
			<li>System to Logical System transition</li>
			<li>LC / LA to PC / PA transition</li>
			<li>Port transition</li>
		</ul>
		<p>An activity is (of course) linked to others activities but categorizing modelling elements into these activities defines entry points for the user to trigger the automated transition.</p>
		<h2 id="Transition_Entry_Points">Transition Entry Points</h2>
		<p>This section provides a simplified version of transition graph for each entry points to trigger transition and determines scope of transition for these entry points.</p>
