Usage Of Content\n\
\n\
THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS\n\
(COLLECTIVELY "CONTENT").  USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND\n\
CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.  BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR USE\n\
OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR\n\
NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS AND\n\
CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY NOT USE THE CONTENT.\n\
\n\
Applicable Licenses\n\
\n\
Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0\n\
("EPL").  A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html.\n\
For purposes of the EPL, "Program" will mean the Content.\n\
\n\
Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and other files maintained in the Eclipse.org CVS repository ("Repository") in CVS\n\
modules ("Modules") and made available as downloadable archives ("Downloads").\n\
   \n\
       - Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content.  Typical modules may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").\n\
       - Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Java(tm) ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".\n\
       - A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material.  Each Feature may be packaged as a sub-directory in a directory named "features".  Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins\n\
         and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.\n\
       - Features may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.\n\
 \n\
The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). The terms and conditions governing Features and\n\
Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html" ("Feature Licenses").  Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module\n\
including, but not limited to the following locations:\n\
\n\
       - The top-level (root) directory\n\
       - Plug-in and Fragment directories\n\
       - Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs\n\
       - Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins\n\
       - Feature directories\n\
		\n\
Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Eclipse Update Manager, you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the\n\
installation process.  If the Feature contains Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the Included Features or\n\
inform you where you can locate them.  Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature.\n\
Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the associated Content in\n\
that directory.\n\
\n\
THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  SOME OF THESE\n\
OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):\n\
\n\
       - Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)\n\
