SiriusComparisonFactory_Label=Configurable comparison method supporting Sirius diagrams
SiriusComparisonMethod_UndoRedoWarning=Since the left and right models are already loaded, they are used as-is for comparison.\n\nA consequence is that undo/redo is not available in the diff/merge editor. Close either model and re-launch the comparison to regain the undo/redo ability.
