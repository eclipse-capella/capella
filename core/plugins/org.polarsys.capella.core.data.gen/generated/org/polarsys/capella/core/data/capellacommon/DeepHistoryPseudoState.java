A composite state\r\ncan have at most one deep history vertex. At most one transition may originate from the history connector to the default\r\ndeep history state. This transition is taken in case the composite state had never been active before. Entry actions of\r\nstates entered on the implicit direct path from the deep history to the innermost state(s) represented by a deep history\r\nare performed. The entry action is preformed only once for each state in the active state configuration being restored.\r\n[source: UML superstructure v2.4]' usage\040guideline='n/a' used\040in\040levels='operational, system, logical, physical' constraints='none' comment/notes='none' reference\040documentation='none'"
