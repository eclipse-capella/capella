Df2ISEngine_0=Non connected element : 
Rule_Event_CannotRetrieveInstanceRoleFromBound=A bound of operation ''{0}'' is not allocated to a component.
Rule_Event_FunctionalExchangeMultiAllocated=Functional Exchange is allocated by more than one Component Exchange.
Rule_Event_FunctionalExchangeMultiAllocatedConveyed=Sequence Message ''{0}'' conveys a Functional Exchange ''{1}'' allocated by more than one Component Exchange.
Rule_Event_SelectionComponentExchange=\nSelect a Component Exchange from the list.
Rule_InstanceRole_AllocatedMoreThanOnce=InstanceRole ''{0}'' covers the Function ''{1}'' which is allocated in more\nthan one Component.
Rule_InstanceRole_AllocatingMultipart=InstanceRole ''{0}'' covers the Function ''{1}'' which is allocated in a\nComponent with more than one Part.
Rule_InstanceRole_CannotProcess_FunctionUnallocated=Function ''{0}'' is not allocated to a component or its leafs are not allocated to the same component.
Rule_InstanceRole_Selection=\ Select a Part of allocating Component for the InstanceRole ''{0}''.
Rule_InstanceRole_TransitionTitle=Transition
Rule_InstanceRole_TransitionTitleDetailled=Transition of ''{0}''
Scenario_MultipleTransitionedElements=Ambigous selection in transition. Select something.
Scenario_SourceMessage=Source of {0} message named ''{1}'' and convoying ''{2}'' {3} cannot be determined automatically.\nPlease select one element from the given list.

Rule_Event_FunctionalExchangeNotAllocated=Functional Exchange ''{0}'' is not allocated to any Component Exchange. Sequence Message ''{1}'' will not convey any operation.
Rule_InteractionState_FailMsg=An interaction state is never transitioned between two different phases.
Rule_InteractionFunctionState_FailMsg=An interaction state with a function cannot be transitioned while exchange scenario to interface scenario.
Rule_StateFragment_FailMsg=A state fragment is never transitioned between two different phases.

MultiInstanceRoleExtension_logmsg=User canceled multi-instancerole scenario transition
MultiInstanceRoleExtension_logmsg_confirm=Executing unsupported transition for multi-instancerole scenario: 
MultiInstanceRoleExtension_message=The scenario to be transitioned contains multiple instance roles with the same represented instance. This is not yet fully supported and may have unexpected results. Press 'Cancel' to abort the transition now, or 'OK' to confirm that the transition should launch anyways.
MultiInstanceRoleExtension_title=Multiple instance roles for same instance
