CapellaComparisonFactory_Label=Configurable comparison method supporting Capella models
CapellaComparisonMethod_Usage_Default=Diff/merge between different versions of the same Capella / Team for Capella model
CapellaComparisonMethod_Usage_Default_Tooltip=Capella elements and graphical elements are matched based on unique identifiers when available.\nRemaining graphical elements are matched based on Semantic criteria.
CapellaComparisonMethod_Usage_P2L=Transfer of elements between a Capella project and a Capella library
CapellaComparisonMethod_Usage_P2L_Tooltip=Supports the exchange of elements between a Capella project (which may use libraries) and a Capella libray.\nIt assumes that one of the selected models is a simple library.
CapellaComparisonMethod_Usage_Transition=Diff/merge between Capella subsystem models transitioned from the same system model
CapellaComparisonMethod_Usage_Transition_Tooltip=Diff/merge between Capella subsystem models that have been initialized from the same Capella system model\nthrough the 'System to Subsystem Transition' add-on.
CapellaDifferenceCategoryProvider_CapellaSet_Description=Differences that are related to Capella.
CapellaDifferenceCategoryProvider_CapellaSet_Text=Semantic Criteria
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_ExchangeEnds=Capella: Further distinguish exchanges/links based on their ends
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_ExchangeEnds_Tooltip=Distinguish exchanges or links (e.g., between functions, components) that have the same name but connect different elements.
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_P2L=Capella: Match project with library
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_P2L_Tooltip=Match a Capella project with a Capella library in order to transfer elements between them.
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_SIDs=Capella: Prefer SIDs to IDs when available
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_SIDs_Tooltip=SIDs are alternative Capella identifiers which carry traceability, e.g., via the System-to-Subsystem add-on.
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_Technical=Capella: Match equivalent technical elements
CapellaMatchPolicy_Criterion_Technical_Tooltip=Certain elements are purely technical and usually invisible to model users, e.g., allocations of Capella functions to components.\nMatch such elements according to their meaning, e.g., match allocations of the same function to the same component.
CapellaScope_DifferentVersion=The model contained in the following file was created with a different version of the tool (%1$s): %2$s\nThe model may need to be migrated. Proceed anyway?
CapellaScope_DifferentVersionInterruption=Interrupted because of unexpected version.
CapellaScope_PermissionCommandName=Get write permission
CapellaScope_WriteError=Write permission cannot be acquired
