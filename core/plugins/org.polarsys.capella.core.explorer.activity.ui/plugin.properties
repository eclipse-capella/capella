operationalAnalysisPageDescription = \
<p>\
Beyond and before requirements, \
the goal of the Operational Analysis is to model the business view of an \
operational domain. It is not focused on the system to be develop but \
on its global environment.\
</p>\
<p>\
Operational Need Analysis is more and more important in complex systems \
engineering: many major customers require or impose this analysis as mandatory \
part of the delivered "architecture".\
</p>

systemAnalysisPageDescription = \
<p>\
The System Analysis level is used to model \
the system viewed like a black box. It clarifies what the system is expected to \
do and what its boundaries are.\
</p>

logicalArchitecturePageDescription = \
<p>\
The Logical Architecture is used to model the system viewed like a white box. \
The Logical Architecture is a justified breakdown of the system or software, \
compliant not only with functional issues, but also with all main non-functional \
concerns susceptible to impact the breakdown.\
</p>\
<p>\
The Logical Architecture is expected to be stable against further engineering \
steps and detailed design choices (unlike the physical architecture).\
</p>

physicalArchitecturePageDescription = \
<p>\
The Physical Architecture is a refinement and enrichment of the Logical \
Architecture, dealing with technological and development constraints, through \
an appropriate organisation and the use of "architectural patterns" or templates \
to rationalise development.\
</p>\
<p>\
The physical architecture identifies all components that will be produced and \
integrated.\
</p>

epbsPageDescription = \
<p>\
The EPBS Architecture level is used to model the system viewed like a \
contractual, organisational and industrial breakdown. It describes the actual \
components chosen to build the System in conformance with expectations described \
at Physical, Logical and System Analysis taking in account contractual, \
organisational and industrial concerns.\
</p>

 of data, database storage, access methods, etc.). In the beginning, concentrate only on elements that provide high-level semantic \
related to the domain.\
